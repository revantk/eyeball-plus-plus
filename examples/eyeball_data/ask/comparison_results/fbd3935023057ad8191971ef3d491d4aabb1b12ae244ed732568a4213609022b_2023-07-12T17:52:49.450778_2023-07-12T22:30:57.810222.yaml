message: 'Response B: "I don''t know."


  Reasoning: The context specifically mentions that the dog is not brown, so stating
  that it is brown is incorrect. The color of the dog is not specified in the context,
  so the correct response would be "I don''t know."


  Therefore, the answer is No -- if Response B is better than A.'
result: POSITIVE
