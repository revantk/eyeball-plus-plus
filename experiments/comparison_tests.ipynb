      "Reason: Both Andrew and Barry provided comprehensive context summaries that align with the query. They both mentioned the decision the founders of Chief, Childers and Kaplan need to make, the factors they need to consider, and the potential strategies they could adopt. They also both touched on the importance of a strong management team, customer retention strategies, and the risks and benefits of expansion. However, Barry's response provides additional information about the founders' decision to blitzscale and raise $22 million in funding, which could be a crucial piece of context depending on the specific details of the query.

They both mention the appealing aspects of the Squire business model and the difficulties the founders faced in raising their seed round. They both also mention the lack of tech experience and expertise among the founders as a challenge. However, Barry's response is more detailed and provides a more in-depth analysis of the situation, including the coastal bias among investors and the challenges in convincing investors of the market size and the viability of their business model.

Edward Tufte – a master of The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, thinks Powerpoint is evil and corrupts absolutely.

Several years ago, Chris Wand (one of the guys that works with me at Mobius Venture Capital) put together a list of questions that a pitch to a VC should address. The world would be a better place if all entreprenuers could automagically incorporate this outline into their pitches – at least to me. Following are the questions to address. 1) WHAT IS YOUR VISION? – What is your big vision? – What problem are you solving and for whom? – Where do you want to be in the future? 2) WHAT IS YOUR MARKET OPPORTUNITY AND HOW BIG IS IT? – How big is the market opportunity you are pursuing and how fast is it growing? – How established (or nascent) is the market? – Do you have a credible claim on being one of the top two or three players in the market?\\n\\nSource: \"https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4A-a-guide-to-seed-fundraising\"\\nthe first money in the company. In other words, meet as many investors as possible but focus on those most likely to close. Always optimize for getting money soonest (in other words, be greedy) 2. There are a few simple rules to follow when preparing to meet with investors. First, make sure you know your audience--do research on what they like to invest in and try to figure out why. Second, simplify your pitch to the essential--why this is a great product (demos are almost a requirement nowadays), why you are precisely the right team to build it, and why together you should all dream about creating the next gigantic company. Next make sure you listen carefully to what the investor has to say. If you can get the investor to talk more than you, your probability of a deal skyrockets. In the same vein, do what you can to connect with the investor. This is one of the main reasons to do research. An investment in a company is a long term commitment and most investors see lots of deals. Unless they like you and feel connected to your outcome, they will most certainly not write a check. Who you are and how well you tell your story are most important when trying to convince investors to write that check. Investors are looking for compelling founders who have a believable dream and as much evidence as possible documenting the reality of that dream.

The entrepreneur with the growth-focused hit every engagement milestone across hundreds of thousands of users, but couldn’t raise the series A because their investor didn’t feel like their growth rate was fast enough – something they weren’t even aiming for! Without the financial support of their seed investor, the company was unable to raise their series A and sadly had to shut down.  The entrepreneur with the engagement-focused investor iterated and iterated against fewer than 1000 users, improving the product – and the associated key performance indicators – thoughtfully and methodically. This entrepreneur\\xa0impressed their engagement-focused investor so much with their learning and experimentation process that they raised a terrific series A – pre-emptively.\\nHuman: Question: What are the essential elements that should be included in a pre-seed first presentation with a potential investor?

The entrepreneur with the growth-focused hit every engagement milestone across hundreds of thousands of users, but couldn’t raise the series A because their investor didn’t feel like their growth rate was fast enough – something they weren’t even aiming for! Without the financial support of their seed investor, the company was unable to raise their series A and sadly had to shut down.

Make sure everyone you are pitching has a strong understanding of what  your company does upfront. In this market, investors should have done their  homework before the pitch, but it is still important to make a strong impression.  This is even more important when presenting to a team’s full partnership. Team Upgrades If your team is not filled out, that is ok. Be upfront about the gaps and your plan  to fill those holes. Investors who are really excited may offer to introduce you to  potential candidates in their network. Provide Historical Context When discussing the opportunity, set up a historical evolution of your category  and explain why we are at an inflection point today and why your solution is the  best in the market. The ‘why now’ and ‘why you’ are both critical for investors. Know the Financials Cold Make sure that you understand the financials enough to be able to explain  them in detail.

Not all  fundraising processes require a pitch deck, but it’s generally an effective way to bring  a new investor up to speed and communicate your company’s vision. The structure of  a pitch deck can vary but below we’ve included some thoughts on how best to tell a  compelling story. These slides include a variety of the data points covered above.

What is Your Ask? Be clear about your “ask” and able to speak to your plan for the use of  proceeds. Investors may push you on valuation expectations and it is up to you  on how much to share. Often we hear “we are raising $X at Y% dilution”. CEO is the Main Presenter CEOs should be doing the talking during the pitch. If a CFO or COO is doing  most of the talking, this can be a yellow flag. Polish Your Presentation If you have the time or resources, hire a designer to make these slides look  professional.

I thought all four of them did a great job! Overall, I had four takeaways: It is important to start your presentation with information about you, the story around your interest in the idea and why you are the right person to drive this forward. I really liked that Eon introduced himself and brought his background in from the beginning, this made the pitch more relatable and enabled me to form more of a “personal” bond with him. It is important to be clear about who your target audience is (ideally outlining a clear schematic of the profile of your customer target group). I think it is important to include a timeline of where you are right now (what you’ve achieved) and where are you heading in the future. I felt the 5-min pitch activity is very time stressed. Simon mentioned that it is easy to focus on just presenting the “gift wrapping” without focusing on what is inside the gift. As such, I feel for tech ventures it is very important to find a way to concisely explain what your product is/does and how it differentiates from competitors technology. This will enable people to better comprehend\\n\\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2004/06/the-torturous-world-of-powerpoint/\"\\nI’ve looked at thousands (tens of thousands?) presentations pitching new businesses since the mid 1990’s.  The vast majority of them suck.  Unfortunately, it’s not Powerpoint’s fault (no – it wouldn’t be better if Freelance has become the standard). It’s the content creators fault. Edward Tufte – a master of The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, thinks Powerpoint is evil and corrupts absolutely.  Blogs like Beyond Bullets help reduce the corruption, but given that I’m trying to get a very specific set of information in a short period of time (usually 30 – 60 minutes), more specificity about what I think is “good” is probably helpful. Several years ago, Chris Wand (one of the guys that works with me at Mobius Venture Capital) put together a list of questions that a pitch to a VC should address. The world would be a better place if all entreprenuers could automagically incorporate this outline into their pitches – at least to me. Following are the questions to address. 1) WHAT IS YOUR VISION? – What is your big vision? – What problem are you solving and for whom? – Where do you want to be in the future? 2) WHAT IS YOUR MARKET OPPORTUNITY AND HOW BIG IS IT? – How big is the market opportunity you are pursuing and how fast is it growing? – How established (or nascent) is the market? – Do you have a credible claim on being one of the top two or three players in the market?\\n\\nSource: \"https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4A-a-guide-to-seed-fundraising\"\\nthe first money in the company. In other words, meet as many investors as possible but focus on those most likely to close. Always optimize for getting money soonest (in other words, be greedy) 2. There are a few simple rules to follow when preparing to meet with investors. First, make sure you know your audience--do research on what they like to invest in and try to figure out why. Second, simplify your pitch to the essential--why this is a great product (demos are almost a requirement nowadays), why you are precisely the right team to build it, and why together you should all dream about creating the next gigantic company. Next make sure you listen carefully to what the investor has to say. If you can get the investor to talk more than you, your probability of a deal skyrockets. In the same vein, do what you can to connect with the investor. This is one of the main reasons to do research. An investment in a company is a long term commitment and most investors see lots of deals. Unless they like you and feel connected to your outcome, they will most certainly not write a check. Who you are and how well you tell your story are most important when trying to convince investors to write that check. Investors are looking for compelling founders who have a believable dream and as much evidence as possible documenting the reality of that dream. Find a style that works for you, and then work as hard as necessary to get the pitch perfect. Pitching is difficult and often unnatural\\n\\nSource: \"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-many-investors-should-you-talk-to-in-a-vc-fund-raise-and-how-do-you-prioritize-7be15aa7136e\"\\n[How Many Investors Should You Talk to in a VC Fund Raise?

The instructor may wish to mention that the leader of the all-male firm was Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, who had prioritized diversity and inclusion throughout his career. The female-led firm was Inspired Capital, led by Penny Pritzker, the former Secretary of Commerce under President Barack Obama, and Alexa Von Tobel, the former founder and CEO of Learnvest. The instructor may then ask, “Given the team’s choice for the amount of capital they decided to raise, what are the implications for Chief moving forward?”  Student responses may include the following:  Chief needs to grow rapidly to justify the higher valuation implied by the amount of funding it had just raised. Childers and Kaplan must make significant progress with the company’s expansion and prove to investors that the market size justifies the amount of capital raised. Childers and Kaplan must prioritize building a management team that can support scaling.  The team must ensure that Chief crafts different customer acquisition and retention strategies according to different cities. The team should also be open to tailoring aspects of the product offering, such as the clubhouse or small group meeting structures, to best accommodate local dynamics. As they expand, Childers and Kaplan should be mindful of the unique city-by-city market dynamics.  Childers and Kaplan must create Chief’s digital platform to build a more scalable and holistic\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 32/37\"\\nefficiency in building start-ups. The more capital that is raised, the more is spent on marginal initiatives. Milestone-based financing with tighter milestones and smaller buffers may lead to more discipline. Again, students may cite examples of their own experiences or that of famous startups that saw false positives in product-market fit and then scaled too aggressively (e.g., Fab.com). The instructor should then present students with a hypothetical situation in which Childers decides to pursue a blitz strategy and receives two term sheets:  Option 1: A strong valuation from a top-tier firm that is all male Option 2: A lower valuation from a new firm that is female-led The instructor should emphasize that the price difference is significant, and ask students, “Which option would you pursue?” Record student responses on Board 7. Some students may argue that Childers and Kaplan should take the option from the male firm since, as a new business, Chief needs both the capital and the power of the firm’s reputation. Other students may counter that Chief has promoted itself as a company that is committed to female empowerment and that taking the investment from the all-male firm would damage Chief’s reputation.  Some students may argue that the decision would depend on the profiles of the women at the female-led firm and may point out that the female-led firm could present important networking and membership opportunities for Chief in the future. Other students may respond that\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 34/37\"\\nChief represents a highly sought-after investment opportunity. Thus, they have an opportunity to try to shape the negotiations such that the financing framework and participants precisely meet their needs rather than simply reacting to what investors want to do. Ultimately, founders must ensure that they have alignment between their customers, their value proposition, unit economics, branding, and their venture capital funding. All factors are interdependent and have an impact on the expansion potential and pacing of a company.   Wrap Up The instructor can then reveal which option Childers and Kaplan chose. The instructor should state that after generating a high degree of investor and member interest, they decided to blitzscale to other cities. The instructor may suggest that a possible motivating factor to support the blitzscale was the importance of first-mover advantage for securing Chief’s target audience in the new cities, given the limited market size and high switching costs associated with women’s executive networking.  The instructor may note that, in June 2019, Childers and Kaplan raised $22 million in funding, combining investments from an all-male firm and a female-led firm. As a result, Childers and Kaplan planned to expand to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., by December 2020. The instructor may wish to mention that the leader of the all-male firm was Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, who had prioritized\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 30/37\"\\nwould join. Each piece of the business model was interdependent.  Because of this, each new city presented a winner-take-all market: only one women’s professional networking organization was likely to thrive in any given place, because only one could have the best network of women. This exacerbated the need for Chief to move quickly, lest other competitors captured the women-centric executive networking market first. On the other hand, rapid expansion might strain resources such that Chief would be unable to successfully acquire target customers in new cities.  At this point, the instructor may conclude the pasture by asking, “Have any of you changed your minds about your initial vote?” The instructor might ask respondents to explain what affected their opinions. Choosing the Right Amount of Capital—And the Right Capital Partner (15 minutes) The instructor should next shift to discuss the fundraising decision that Childers and Kaplan would face if they chose to expand. The instructor can show their decision map on Board 6, illustrating how much stake in Chief Childers and Kaplan would give up by raising different amounts of capital at varying valuations. While raising a large amount of capital gives a young company more resources, its existing owners must weigh how much ownership dilution they are willing to accept to accommodate new investors who contribute additional capital. The instructor might point out that delaying expansion would likely give Chief a higher valuation,\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 17/37\"\\nThere was a clear demand among female executives for the services that Chief provided. For example, Sujean Lee, the COO of Milk Bar, noted that her job “was such a rewarding professional experience, but it was also stressful and intense and at times lonely. I wished I had more people who understood what I was going through” (case p. 6). Of the available executive networking services and women-centric networking services, only Chief provided the support and camaraderie that Lee and her peers sought. These sentiments were likely universal among highly successful women and indicated that Chief would have significant demand in other cities. An important factor in the question of the pacing of expansion is access to capital. At this stage of the conversation, students may raise the fact that aggressive expansion would require a large and successful fundraising round(s). Chief was not a software-based startup with any intellectual property and thus may not be as attractive to venture capitalist funders. Further, Childers and Kaplan were first-time founders. Women have historically had a difficult time accessing venture capital to fuel their start-ups. Research has shown that female entrepreneurs are asked more “prevention-focused questions” that focus on not losing capital, while male entrepreneurs are given the chance to answer more “promotion-focused questions” that focus on attaining growth. Emerging evidence finds that these disparities are most pronounced in more\\n\\nSource: \"Chief 920021-PDF-ENG.pdf - Page 1\"\\nKATHERINE B. COFFMAN   JEFFREY J. BUSSGANG   KATHLEEN L.

As they  waited   in Chief’s recently  renovated, members -only  Tribeca  Clubhouse,  the two co-founders  were amazed  by  how  much  they  had accomplished.  (See Exhibit 1 for photos  of Chief’s  Clubhouse.)   Childers and Kaplan  had first met to discuss Chief  in 2018.  Over  coffee, Childers shared her initial   vision  for Chie f, an organization  that would  provide  support  to women executives  at the vice president   (VP)  and C-suite  level.  She explained  how  the vast majority  of these  executives  had reached a stage  in  their  career where they  were more  isolated,  often as the only  woman  in the room.  (See Exhibit  2 for a  pitch  deck  slide  summarizing the reasons  for launching  Chief.)  This  experience was personal  for  Childers and Kaplan,  each  of whom had risen  to the senior  vice president  (SVP) level  in male - dominated  startups —Handy  and Casper, respectively. Childers  was in itially unsure  about whether   she should  launch Chief  alone  or with  a co-founder,  but Kaplan,  with  her brand  and marketing\\n\\nSource: \"ENTRE_M5_BV3_02.22.2023_READY FOR BETA.docx - 13/119\"\\nBusiness School, Mark Conley of Stockholm School of Economics, and E. Tory Higgins of Columbia University, published research in the Academy of Management Journal on how early conversations between VCs and entrepreneurs—specifically in the Q&A portion of the pitch—can predict future funding outcomes.  The researchers analyzed the question and answer interactions between VCs and entrepreneurs at a fundraising competition and then tracked the subsequent funding rounds for startups launched at the event. They observed that VCs of both genders posed different types of questions to male and female founders. In particular: Two thirds of questions posed to male entrepreneurs were focused on hopes and future achievements, while two thirds of questions posed to female entrepreneurs were focused on risk and responsibility. This difference in questioning led to a drastic difference in funding. While the startups they tracked were comparable in terms of quality and capital needs, they found that male-led startups in the sample raised five times more funding than female-led ones. We are all human, and recognizing our biases takes time and practice. But, as participants in this industry, it is important to understand and acknowledge these biases and, if you wish to engage as a leader, contribute to the solution and help close the gender funding gap.  How might we do that? Brainstorm and share some ways you think you could shrink the gender financing gap in the following activity.

Kaplan needed to weigh the risks and opportunities of joining Chief. Instructors can use these role materials as the basis of a negotiation exercise that focuses on the co-founder selection process. Key issues include understanding the factors that determine whether a co-founder is needed, what qualities to search for in a co-founder, and what topics need to be discussed when beginning a start-up venture together.  “Scaling at Chief” explores events after Childers and Kaplan launched Chief. The first Chief branch opened in New York City in January 2019 and experienced immediate success. More than 1,000 women joined the waitlist in October 2018, and the number of paid members exceeded Childers and Kaplan’s annual goal by February 2019. Childers and Kaplan initially planned to focus on the New York City branch for Chief’s first year, but given early indications of demand in other cities, they considered moving up their timeline for expansion and scaling more aggressively.  At the end of the “Scaling at Chief” case, Childers and Kaplan had to decide appropriate next steps for Chief. They could undertake a moderate strategy in which they raise a modest amount of capital and expand to two additional cities, Boston and Washington, DC; they could raise a larger amount of capital and\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 3/37\"\\nThey could undertake a moderate strategy in which they raise a modest amount of capital and expand to two additional cities, Boston and Washington, DC; they could raise a larger amount of capital and aggressively expand to five cities by adding Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco; or they could pursue their original plan to focus exclusively on New York City to develop their nascent offering and operations and avoid the distraction of fundraising altogether. While expansion presented the opportunity to capitalize on Chief’s early momentum, Childers and Kaplan wondered whether to focus first on unfinished business in New York, such as filling key staff positions and building Chief’s technology platform. The technology platform would allow members to stay in touch between meetings, seek advice from the entire Chief network, and cultivate a stronger sense of community within Chief (case p. 5). Childers and Kaplan also needed to determine how to mitigate the operational and quality risks involved with a more rapid expansion.   Instructors can use this collection of cases to illustrate the decision points that a young company faces. First, how does one identify the right co-founder, and what are best practices for negotiating with a potential co-founder? After early successes, what should founders factor into strategic and operational decisions about growth? What factors should be given weight in decisions about raising second round capital?

Thus, they have an opportunity to try to shape the negotiations such that the financing framework and participants precisely meet their needs rather than simply reacting to what investors want to do.

The instructor may note that, in June 2019, Childers and Kaplan raised $22 million in funding, combining investments from an all-male firm and a female-led firm. As a result, Childers and Kaplan planned to expand to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., by December 2020.

Each piece of the business model was interdependent.  Because of this, each new city presented a winner-take-all market: only one women’s professional networking organization was likely to thrive in any given place, because only one could have the best network of women.

On the other hand, rapid expansion might strain resources such that Chief would be unable to successfully acquire target customers in new cities.

The researchers analyzed the question and answer interactions between VCs and entrepreneurs at a fundraising competition and then tracked the subsequent funding rounds for startups launched at the event. They observed that VCs of both genders posed different types of questions to male and female founders. In particular: Two thirds of questions posed to male entrepreneurs were focused on hopes and future achievements, while two thirds of questions posed to female entrepreneurs were focused on risk and responsibility. This difference in questioning led to a drastic difference in funding. While the startups they tracked were comparable in terms of quality and capital needs, they found that male-led startups in the sample raised five times more funding than female-led ones. We are all human, and recognizing our biases takes time and practice. But, as participants in this industry, it is important to understand and acknowledge these biases and, if you wish to engage as a leader, contribute to the solution and help close the gender funding gap.

Kaplan needed to weigh the risks and opportunities of joining Chief. Instructors can use these role materials as the basis of a negotiation exercise that focuses on the co-founder selection process. Key issues include understanding the factors that determine whether a co-founder is needed, what qualities to search for in a co-founder, and what topics need to be discussed when beginning a start-up venture together.  “Scaling at Chief” explores events after Childers and Kaplan launched Chief. The first Chief branch opened in New York City in January 2019 and experienced immediate success. More than 1,000 women joined the waitlist in October 2018, and the number of paid members exceeded Childers and Kaplan’s annual goal by February 2019. Childers and Kaplan initially planned to focus on the New York City branch for Chief’s first year, but given early indications of demand in other cities, they considered moving up their timeline for expansion and scaling more aggressively.  At the end of the “Scaling at Chief” case, Childers and Kaplan had to decide appropriate next steps for Chief.

While expansion presented the opportunity to capitalize on Chief’s early momentum, Childers and Kaplan wondered whether to focus first on unfinished business in New York, such as filling key staff positions and building Chief’s technology platform. The technology platform would allow members to stay in touch between meetings, seek advice from the entire Chief network, and cultivate a stronger sense of community within Chief (case p. 5). Childers and Kaplan also needed to determine how to mitigate the operational and quality risks involved with a more rapid expansion.   Instructors can use this collection of cases to illustrate the decision points that a young company faces. First, how does one identify the right co-founder, and what are best practices for negotiating with a potential co-founder?

Student responses may include:  Membership renewals had not been put to the test and yet were critical to the business model. Childers and Kaplan should therefore conduct surveys and actual tests of renewal offers (perhaps through one-time, promotional deals such as “early renewal” or multi-year membership offers at a discount) among their membership base to understand the specific factors that drove customer retention.  Childers and Kaplan should conduct more thorough research on expected demand for Chief in the cities they were considering for expansion, determining what the differences were in those cities as compared to New York City and whether there were local organizations or institutions that could be either prospective partners or competitors.  Chief’s Product-Market Fit (15 Minutes) The decision to aggressively expand hinged on (1) whether the market opportunity was truly massive—i.e., was there large demand for women-centric executive networking across multiple major cities; and (2) whether the initial Chief offering was a direct hit or needed adjustment.

The Expansion Decision (10 minutes) To transition to “Scaling at Chief,” the instructor can quickly bring the students from Childers and Kaplan’s early negotiation to the decision point in the case by summarizing Chief’s early successes. At the end of the summary, introduce the dilemma that Childers and Kaplan faced regarding their decision to expand. The instructor should frame their dilemma as that of a business with early signs of a strong product-market fit that needed to determine how—and whether—to expand.

Throughout these decisions, the strength of Childers’s and Kaplan’s relationship likely played a key role: their clear separation of responsibilities, different skillsets, and their shared vision made navigating the scaling decision easier.

Ask students, “What are some of the pros of having a co-founder? What are some of the cons?” Pros might include bringing on additional expertise, sharing responsibilities, and accessing a new network. Cons might include giving up power and control, equity ownership dilution, misalignment of priorities or interests—leading to potential conflict—and the search costs involved in finding the right partner.  With these lists in mind, push students to evaluate how these factors might inform whether to bring on a co-founder and the situations in which a founder is more or less likely to benefit from having a co-founder. At this point, it may be helpful to call on students assigned to the Childers role to ask them how they thought about this issue while preparing for the negotiation exercise. Ask, “Why is this a good situation in which to seek a co-founder?” Answers are likely to focus on Kaplan’s complementary expertise in brand building and Childers’s desire to have Kaplan fully invested in Chief’s success. Ask students, both in Childers and Kaplan roles, what steps they took during the negotiation to gather information about whether this was a good co-founder fit. How did they make this judgment? An interesting point of tension to discuss is the role of similarity in building a team.

The female-led firm was Inspired Capital, led by Penny Pritzker, the former Secretary of Commerce under President Barack Obama, and Alexa Von Tobel, the former founder and CEO of Learnvest. The instructor may then ask, “Given the team’s choice for the amount of capital they decided to raise, what are the implications for Chief moving forward?”  Student responses may include the following:  Chief needs to grow rapidly to justify the higher valuation implied by the amount of funding it had just raised. Childers and Kaplan must make significant progress with the company’s expansion and prove to investors that the market size justifies the amount of capital raised. Childers and Kaplan must prioritize building a management team that can support scaling.  The team must ensure that Chief crafts different customer acquisition and retention strategies according to different cities. The team should also be open to tailoring aspects of the product offering, such as the clubhouse or small group meeting structures, to best accommodate local dynamics.

Thus, they have an opportunity to try to shape the negotiations such that the financing framework and participants precisely meet their needs rather than simply reacting to what investors want to do. Ultimately, founders must ensure that they have alignment between their customers, their value proposition, unit economics, branding, and their venture capital funding. All factors are interdependent and have an impact on the expansion potential and pacing of a company.   Wrap Up The instructor can then reveal which option Childers and Kaplan chose. The instructor should state that after generating a high degree of investor and member interest, they decided to blitzscale to other cities. The instructor may suggest that a possible motivating factor to support the blitzscale was the importance of first-mover advantage for securing Chief’s target audience in the new cities, given the limited market size and high switching costs associated with women’s executive networking.  The instructor may note that, in June 2019, Childers and Kaplan raised $22 million in funding, combining investments from an all-male firm and a female-led firm. As a result, Childers and Kaplan planned to expand to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., by December 2020. The instructor may wish to mention that the leader of the all-male firm was Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, who had prioritized\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 3/37\"\\nThey could undertake a moderate strategy in which they raise a modest amount of capital and expand to two additional cities, Boston and Washington, DC; they could raise a larger amount of capital and aggressively expand to five cities by adding Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco; or they could pursue their original plan to focus exclusively on New York City to develop their nascent offering and operations and avoid the distraction of fundraising altogether. While expansion presented the opportunity to capitalize on Chief’s early momentum, Childers and Kaplan wondered whether to focus first on unfinished business in New York, such as filling key staff positions and building Chief’s technology platform. The technology platform would allow members to stay in touch between meetings, seek advice from the entire Chief network, and cultivate a stronger sense of community within Chief (case p. 5). Childers and Kaplan also needed to determine how to mitigate the operational and quality risks involved with a more rapid expansion.   Instructors can use this collection of cases to illustrate the decision points that a young company faces. First, how does one identify the right co-founder, and what are best practices for negotiating with a potential co-founder? After early successes, what should founders factor into strategic and operational decisions about growth? What factors should be given weight in decisions about raising second round capital? Throughout each discussion\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 30/37\"\\nwould join. Each piece of the business model was interdependent.  Because of this, each new city presented a winner-take-all market: only one women’s professional networking organization was likely to thrive in any given place, because only one could have the best network of women. This exacerbated the need for Chief to move quickly, lest other competitors captured the women-centric executive networking market first. On the other hand, rapid expansion might strain resources such that Chief would be unable to successfully acquire target customers in new cities.  At this point, the instructor may conclude the pasture by asking, “Have any of you changed your minds about your initial vote?” The instructor might ask respondents to explain what affected their opinions. Choosing the Right Amount of Capital—And the Right Capital Partner (15 minutes) The instructor should next shift to discuss the fundraising decision that Childers and Kaplan would face if they chose to expand. The instructor can show their decision map on Board 6, illustrating how much stake in Chief Childers and Kaplan would give up by raising different amounts of capital at varying valuations. While raising a large amount of capital gives a young company more resources, its existing owners must weigh how much ownership dilution they are willing to accept to accommodate new investors who contribute additional capital. The instructor might point out that delaying expansion would likely give Chief a higher valuation,\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 2/37\"\\nown skills and expertise. “Chief: Role for Lindsay Kaplan” explores the role of Lindsay Kaplan, an experienced start-up marketer and brand builder, whom Childers approached to be co-founder of Chief. Kaplan needed to weigh the risks and opportunities of joining Chief. Instructors can use these role materials as the basis of a negotiation exercise that focuses on the co-founder selection process. Key issues include understanding the factors that determine whether a co-founder is needed, what qualities to search for in a co-founder, and what topics need to be discussed when beginning a start-up venture together.  “Scaling at Chief” explores events after Childers and Kaplan launched Chief. The first Chief branch opened in New York City in January 2019 and experienced immediate success. More than 1,000 women joined the waitlist in October 2018, and the number of paid members exceeded Childers and Kaplan’s annual goal by February 2019. Childers and Kaplan initially planned to focus on the New York City branch for Chief’s first year, but given early indications of demand in other cities, they considered moving up their timeline for expansion and scaling more aggressively.  At the end of the “Scaling at Chief” case, Childers and Kaplan had to decide appropriate next steps for Chief. They could undertake a moderate strategy in which they raise a modest amount of capital and expand to two additional cities, Boston and Washington, DC; they could raise a larger amount of capital and\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 25/37\"\\nnext ask, “For those who would opt for either moderate expansion or waiting (the conservative strategy), what would you do if Carolyn Childers and Lindsay Kaplan hired you as their chief of staff and asked for a 30-day plan? What tests would you recommend conducting to inform your plan?” Record student suggestions on Board 5.  Student responses may include:  Membership renewals had not been put to the test and yet were critical to the business model.

Throughout each discussion pasture, the instructor may also prompt students to discuss what, if anything, gives Chief a competitive advantage over its rivals and if there are characteristics of the Chief business model that are more or less conducive to scaling rapidly.   Teaching Objectives How to decide whether to bring-on a co-founder, and what qualities to look for in a co-founder.  What topics need to be addressed in a co-founder negotiation.  How to discern the appropriate pacing for scaling a start-up based on the business model characteristics and results of early expertiments. How a start-up’s fundraising strategy aligns with its business model and pacing for scaling. The Chief cases could be taught across a variety of MBA and executive education courses, including strategy and entrepreneurship courses. At Harvard Business School, Chief has been taught in Launching Technology Ventures (LTV). LTV is designed to teach students about the challenges and decision points that early-stage start-ups face prior to achieving product-market fit. The course is intended for students who plan to work at start-ups, pursue roles in more mature technology companies, or start their own businesses.

Get specific: what time, resources, and expertise will each person be commiting to the venture? What process will be used to resolve future questions and disagreements? Shared expectations reduce the chances of dysfunctional conflict in the future. How the business will be organized: This is more than just titles—what does a reasonable organizational chart look like for this business? Who will be in charge of which aspects of the business? The Expansion Decision (10 minutes) To transition to “Scaling at Chief,” the instructor can quickly bring the students from Childers and Kaplan’s early negotiation to the decision point in the case by summarizing Chief’s early successes. At the end of the summary, introduce the dilemma that Childers and Kaplan faced regarding their decision to expand. The instructor should frame their dilemma as that of a business with early signs of a strong product-market fit that needed to determine how—and whether—to expand. The instructor may wish to divide the potential options into three categories: a so-called blitzscaling strategy of aggressive expansion into five cities, a moderate\\n\\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2012/05/book-the-founders-dilemmas/\"\\n[Book: The Founder’s Dilemmas]\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 3/37\"\\nThey could undertake a moderate strategy in which they raise a modest amount of capital and expand to two additional cities, Boston and Washington, DC; they could raise a larger amount of capital and aggressively expand to five cities by adding Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco; or they could pursue their original plan to focus exclusively on New York City to develop their nascent offering and operations and avoid the distraction of fundraising altogether. While expansion presented the opportunity to capitalize on Chief’s early momentum, Childers and Kaplan wondered whether to focus first on unfinished business in New York, such as filling key staff positions and building Chief’s technology platform. The technology platform would allow members to stay in touch between meetings, seek advice from the entire Chief network, and cultivate a stronger sense of community within Chief (case p. 5). Childers and Kaplan also needed to determine how to mitigate the operational and quality risks involved with a more rapid expansion.   Instructors can use this collection of cases to illustrate the decision points that a young company faces. First, how does one identify the right co-founder, and what are best practices for negotiating with a potential co-founder? After early successes, what should founders factor into strategic and operational decisions about growth? What factors should be given weight in decisions about raising second round capital? Throughout each discussion\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 30/37\"\\nwould join. Each piece of the business model was interdependent.  Because of this, each new city presented a winner-take-all market: only one women’s professional networking organization was likely to thrive in any given place, because only one could have the best network of women. This exacerbated the need for Chief to move quickly, lest other competitors captured the women-centric executive networking market first. On the other hand, rapid expansion might strain resources such that Chief would be unable to successfully acquire target customers in new cities.  At this point, the instructor may conclude the pasture by asking, “Have any of you changed your minds about your initial vote?” The instructor might ask respondents to explain what affected their opinions. Choosing the Right Amount of Capital—And the Right Capital Partner (15 minutes) The instructor should next shift to discuss the fundraising decision that Childers and Kaplan would face if they chose to expand. The instructor can show their decision map on Board 6, illustrating how much stake in Chief Childers and Kaplan would give up by raising different amounts of capital at varying valuations. While raising a large amount of capital gives a young company more resources, its existing owners must weigh how much ownership dilution they are willing to accept to accommodate new investors who contribute additional capital. The instructor might point out that delaying expansion would likely give Chief a higher valuation,\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 37/37\"\\nqualities and was thus an example of a company that could benefit from aggressive scaling, but whether they achieved the execution of the aggressive scaling strategy remained to be seen. Throughout these decisions, the strength of Childers’s and Kaplan’s relationship likely played a key role: their clear separation of responsibilities, different skillsets, and their shared vision made navigating the scaling decision easier.

Key issues include understanding the factors that determine whether a co-founder is needed, what qualities to search for in a co-founder, and what topics need to be discussed when beginning a start-up venture together.  “Scaling at Chief” explores events after Childers and Kaplan launched Chief. The first Chief branch opened in New York City in January 2019 and experienced immediate success. More than 1,000 women joined the waitlist in October 2018, and the number of paid members exceeded Childers and Kaplan’s annual goal by February 2019. Childers and Kaplan initially planned to focus on the New York City branch for Chief’s first year, but given early indications of demand in other cities, they considered moving up their timeline for expansion and scaling more aggressively.  At the end of the “Scaling at Chief” case, Childers and Kaplan had to decide appropriate next steps for Chief.

Key issues include understanding the factors that determine whether a co-founder is needed, what qualities to search for in a co-founder, and what topics need to be discussed when beginning a start-up venture together. “Scaling at Chief” explores events after Childers and Kaplan launched Chief. The first Chief branch opened in New York City in January 2019 and experienced immediate success. More than 1,000 women joined the waitlist in October 2018, and the number of paid members exceeded Childers and Kaplan’s annual goal by February 2019. Childers and Kaplan initially planned to focus on the New York City branch for Chief’s first year, but given early indications of demand in other cities, they considered moving up their timeline for expansion and scaling more aggressively. At the end of the “Scaling at Chief” case, Childers and Kaplan had to decide appropriate next steps for Chief. They could undertake a moderate strategy in which they raise a modest amount of capital and expand to two additional cities, Boston and Washington, DC; they could raise a larger amount of capital and\\n\\nSource: \"ENTRE_M3_BV3_05_17_2023 Jeff W1 Changes.docx - 73/120\"\\nthis course page. 3.

Teaching Element: Protagonist Video_Chief’s Decision_Kaplan [3.2.3 Protagonist Video: Chief’s Decision] Chief had to consider this trade off when thinking about dilution: they felt they had strong network effects and they had to remain competitive, but if they prioritized getting slightly more funding and growing quickly, they would be accepting more dilution. Let’s learn from Lindsay what they chose to do and why. Lindsay Kaplan, Chief [00:24:27.13] LINDSAY KAPLAN: Raising such a big series A felt like the best choice for us. Either way, we were going to grow. Either way, we still had to remain focused on our core member experience in New York.

Throughout these decisions, the strength of Childers’s and Kaplan’s relationship likely played a key role: their clear separation of responsibilities, different skillsets, and their shared vision made navigating the scaling decision easier.

Now the pressure really begins.  Your employees start doing what I call \"phantom equity math\" (if this company were worth a billion dollars, I\\'d become a multimillionare!), your VCs shift you in their mental models from \"too early to tell\" to \"high return potential\" and your spouse starts asking about when all that hard work is going to really pay off. Yet, the hard scaling challenges and decisions that will enable true value creation, not just interim progress, are all ahead of you.  Here are a few of the top ones that I see start-ups wrestle with once they start seeing their initial revenue projections finally come to fruition: Each of these decisions can be gut-wrenching, bet the company moves.  There\\'s a nasty image I hear used in the board room about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

Or s hould they continue their investment in the product and customer success, following the PLG path even further to build a larger m ore valuable company at a faster rate ? Or was it time to invest in building out a sales and marketing team, much as Atlassian, Dropbox, Slack, and Zoom did as they scaled?

Childers also worried about the operational risk of devoting less of her time to managing the nascent old business: “If we were to go and fundraise now, I’d have to dedica te 100% of my time to fundraising.” More b roadly, Childers and Kaplan knew that moving ahead too quickly could negatively impact Chief’s reputation and customer acquisition efforts as well as the all-important metric of renewals. They did not yet have visibility into renewal rates, though initial customer satisfaction levels were high. Now What? One of Chief’s investors would soon be coming to the company’s office to get the co- founders’ thoughts in advance of a key board meeting. Childers and Kaplan wanted to use the meeting as a dry run for the board meeting and had prepared a few operating plan scenarios. But they still had to determine their recommendation. Should they risk the dangers of going too fast, or follow the more classic playbook of incremental scaling? How much money should they raise and when?

What factors should be given weight in decisions about raising second round capital? Throughout each discussion pasture, the instructor may also prompt students to discuss what, if anything, gives Chief a competitive advantage over its rivals and if there are characteristics of the Chief business model that are more or less conducive to scaling rapidly. Teaching Objectives How to decide whether to bring-on a co-founder, and what qualities to look for in a co-founder. What topics need to be addressed in a co-founder negotiation. How to discern the appropriate pacing for scaling a start-up based on the business model characteristics and results of early expertiments. How a start-up’s fundraising strategy aligns with its business model and pacing for scaling. The Chief cases could be taught across a variety of MBA and executive education courses, including strategy and entrepreneurship courses. At Harvard Business School, Chief has been taught in Launching Technology Ventures (LTV). LTV is designed to teach students about the challenges and decision points that early-stage start-ups face prior to achieving product-market fit. The course is intended for students who plan to work at start-ups, pursue roles in more mature technology companies, or start their own businesses.

Few criteria (amongst many) for successful venture funding for early-stage companies are : 1) founder charisma/background/market fit 2) large TAM/SAM – large growing market with a reasonable assumption around percentage of market share needed to be a scaled business 3) whitespace opportunity / skew propensity.In this case, Squire did not check the boxes for investors which led to less favorable funding early on. When I also evaluated Squire in the lens of an investor, I struggled with problems around TAM and expected cap on SMBs ability to pay, but after hearing Dave talk about expanding the pie through increased revenue capture and the increasing ARPU over time, it definitely challenged my preconceived notions but also showed me that very few investors would have known that was possible (founders included).

Another business issue that investors might raise to Squire came from the discussion of different barbershop business models on case pp. 4-6. Squire did not work well for barbers who used the common rent-a-chair business model (case p. 6). In addition, to ensure the greatest customer satisfaction and engagement with Squire, the company required barbershops to stop using other booking or payments systems they had in place. This allowed Squire to deeply embed its product in barbershops’ workflows but could be a barrier to adoption for some shops, especially shops that were not run by tech-savvy owners or did not serve a tech-savvy clientele. Salvant and LaRon also faced early struggles to find tech talent and to build their product. The two founders were first-timers with zero entrepreneurial experience, lacked tech experience and expertise, and their early attempts to hire developers all failed. One developer was a known conman who tried to steal their money (case p. 3). Although they probably did not reveal that mistake to investors, many investors prefer at least one member of a founding team to have product development experience. Students may also raise the challenging unit economics, on the surface. Those unit economics may come up at this point in the discussion (see below) or later when the instructor asks for a more detailed assessment of the quality of the business model (below).\\n\\nSource: \"ENTRE_M2_BV3_05_17_2023 Jeff W1 Changes.docx - 39/136\"\\nwere very early in their startup journey and came with a $20,000 grant. Once they finished this three to four-month program, the co-founders were accepted into the YC Core program along with roughly 100 other startups. To compete in the program, the pair moved from New York City to San Francisco, California, for the summer. They took this opportunity to reach out to barbers in the area, sign them up to use the Squire app, and gather more information on usage. At the end of the summer, all founders enrolled in the YC Core program had the opportunity to pitch their startups to investors at an event called “demo day.” The purpose of the pitch event was to generate interest in their startup from investors and secure capital. Dave and Songe brought in a barber chair for the event and gave free haircuts to potential investors while pitching the Squire business model. They pitched between 75 and 100 investors but struggled to generate any interest or funding compared to other founders in their YC cohort.  For the following video, take note of what gave investors pause about the Squire business and why.   Songe LaRon and Dave Salvant, Squire [00:24:48.15] SONGE LARON: Yeah, so at first, market size was always an issue that frankly, we struggled with because this industry is very underserved, and it\\'s very fragmented, and it\\'s governed by state law, which means there\\'s 50 different laws that apply to barbershops.

At first, it was a lot of questioning the TAM, which we mentioned, not seeing how big the opportunity was. At that time, 2015, 2016, vertical SaaS wasn\\'t really sexy. And SMB vertical SaaS definitely wasn\\'t sexy. And I think there was a little bit of what I would call coastal bias, elite bias, where a lot of these investors themselves probably didn\\'t go to barbershops or didn\\'t have any connection to the culture and to that industry so they just made assumptions about how niche was and how it really wasn\\'t something that was really ubiquitous.

Pedagogical Overview The case presents students with two distinct but related challenges: evaluating Squire’s business model and assessing to what extent race may have played a role in the founders’ early struggles to raise capital. It is clear from the case facts that investors’ views about Squire’s potential have improved dramatically over the first six years. Squire has made progress in running the vertical SaaS playbook, but still has untapped avenues. To what extent was early investor pessimism due to legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model, and to what extent was it due to racial bias?  Squire’s Business Model Students can begin their investigation by assessing the merits and weaknesses of Squire’s business model from a variety of angles. The case allows for an especially rich discussion of three components of Squire’s business model: market sizing, unit economics, and the evolution of unit economics illuminated via cohort analysis. Beyond the present context of assessing the strength of Squire’s business model, these are necessary tools for any founder, and applying them to Squire will serve as a valuable introduction or refresher. Market sizeSquire’s founders report that they often received pushback from investors around the question of market size (case p.\\n\\nSource: \"Squire Teaching Note.docx - 10/34\"\\nbillion—an extraordinary figure for a software company that was originally seen as approaching a niche industry with a single POS product. This pattern of penetrating a vertical market with a simple SaaS product and then adding additional follow-on products, including financial services, to expand ARPU, LTV, and TAM is essentially the vertical SaaS playbook. Squire has the opportunity to execute this playbook with barbershops, and this case is an opportunity to learn that playbook for this particular vertical industry. See the Andreesen Horowitz blog post in the Recommended Additional Readings section for more on this topic. Racial Bias in Venture Capital and Venture-Backed Entrepreneurship A central theme throughout the case is the founders’ struggle to raise VC in their early days. The questions students are left with are: To what extent is this accounted for by legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model and prospects, and to what extent is this the result of implicit or explicit bias against Black founders? As the above analysis indicates, there was room to doubt Squire’s success in the early days. However, there is always room to doubt the success of early-stage ventures—indeed Jesse Middleton, WeWork cofounder and Squire’s first angel investor, says in the case (p. 4), “[W]hen you’re investing in early-stage prototypes, you look for one or two reasons to invest, not the hundreds of reasons not to.” And as for Salvant’s assessment of the causes of Squire’s early\\n\\nSource: \"LTV 2022 Slack.docx - 99/214\"\\nfew investors would have known that was possible (founders included). And in this case, did Squire get lucky? Which early-stage investor would have betted that these founders would have been able to get such loyal customers and get so much revenue in a fairly unproven business model?The fact that early-stage investing is not clear cut with few indicators is probably why so many VC funds look to others for validation and signaling and explains why within 7mo a company can get a 5x step-up in valuation. I struggled with the fact that one person / fund can change the trajectory of the business and if they had not received any initial funding – where would the business be today? How much of a startup’s success is based on the founder pedigree and ability to fundraise vs. the actual business? I wonder if there is a way to neutralize biases (especially when it is done at a widescale level) – perhaps through more standardized data and sharing around valuations and metrics? How has the industry worked to rectify systematic biases since this case was written? Also, I would love to talk more about how VC funds think about sharing allocation and looking to other funds for signals – has this led to successful outcomes? In some ways this seems like a boy’s club where people who are friends just give deals to each other and share their research, and another way to perpetuate biases…\\xa0(edited)\\xa0 Jeffrey Bussgang\\xa0\\xa05:42 PM On the question from\\xa0@Amna Ali\\xa0regarding right and wrong with respect\\n\\nSource: \"Squire Teaching Note.docx - 16/34\"\\nSalvant, case p.4 Lack of tech experience/expertise on the founding team; early struggles building their product                            Disrespected in meetings with investors Barbershops are often a low-tech business and thus slow to adopt technology into their business processes                 Strong credentials – JPMorgan, Yale Law, Y Combinator – White entrepreneurs with those credentials would not struggle to raise seed money Not every barbershop business model works equally well with Squire—thus, the small TAM would be further diminished        Jumping through hoops to raise money – YC fellowship before they could do the “real YC,” moving to Buffalo to get $650K Talk about, but no evidence of, adding follow-on products and services such as fintech elements (e.g., payments, credit)  Rich investors may not see the pain points that normal people face getting a haircut                                                                                                                           Investors see this as a business for Black barbershops, further reducing the TAM in their minds Source:\\tCasewriter.

How has the industry worked to rectify systematic biases since this case was written? Also, I would love to talk more about how VC funds think about sharing allocation and looking to other funds for signals – has this led to successful outcomes?

Once they finished this three to four-month program, the co-founders were accepted into the YC Core program along with roughly 100 other startups. To compete in the program, the pair moved from New York City to San Francisco, California, for the summer. They took this opportunity to reach out to barbers in the area, sign them up to use the Squire app, and gather more information on usage. At the end of the summer, all founders enrolled in the YC Core program had the opportunity to pitch their startups to investors at an event called “demo day.” The purpose of the pitch event was to generate interest in their startup from investors and secure capital. Dave and Songe brought in a barber chair for the event and gave free haircuts to potential investors while pitching the Squire business model. They pitched between 75 and 100 investors but struggled to generate any interest or funding compared to other founders in their YC cohort. For the following video, take note of what gave investors pause about the Squire business and why.

Few criteria (amongst many) for successful venture funding for early-stage companies are : 1) founder charisma/background/market fit 2) large TAM/SAM – large growing market with a reasonable assumption around percentage of market share needed to be a scaled business 3) whitespace opportunity / skew propensity.In this case, Squire did not check the boxes for investors which led to less favorable funding early on. When I also evaluated Squire in the lens of an investor, I struggled with problems around TAM and expected cap on SMBs ability to pay, but after hearing Dave talk about expanding the pie through increased revenue capture and the increasing ARPU over time, it definitely challenged my preconceived notions but also showed me that very few investors would have known that was possible (founders included). And in this case, did Squire get lucky?

Pedagogical Overview The case presents students with two distinct but related challenges: evaluating Squire’s business model and assessing to what extent race may have played a role in the founders’ early struggles to raise capital. It is clear from the case facts that investors’ views about Squire’s potential have improved dramatically over the first six years. Squire has made progress in running the vertical SaaS playbook, but still has untapped avenues. To what extent was early investor pessimism due to legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model, and to what extent was it due to racial bias? Squire’s Business Model Students can begin their investigation by assessing the merits and weaknesses of Squire’s business model from a variety of angles. The case allows for an especially rich discussion of three components of Squire’s business model: market sizing, unit economics, and the evolution of unit economics illuminated via cohort analysis. Beyond the present context of assessing the strength of Squire’s business model, these are necessary tools for any founder, and applying them to Squire will serve as a valuable introduction or refresher. Market sizeSquire’s founders report that they often received pushback from investors around the question of market size (case p.\\nSource: \"Squire Teaching Note.docx - 10/34\"\\nbillion—an extraordinary figure for a software company that was originally seen as approaching a niche industry with a single POS product. This pattern of penetrating a vertical market with a simple SaaS product and then adding additional follow-on products, including financial services, to expand ARPU, LTV, and TAM is essentially the vertical SaaS playbook. Squire has the opportunity to execute this playbook with barbershops, and this case is an opportunity to learn that playbook for this particular vertical industry. See the Andreesen Horowitz blog post in the Recommended Additional Readings section for more on this topic. Racial Bias in Venture Capital and Venture-Backed Entrepreneurship A central theme throughout the case is the founders’ struggle to raise VC in their early days. The questions students are left with are: To what extent is this accounted for by legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model and prospects, and to what extent is this the result of implicit or explicit bias against Black founders? As the above analysis indicates, there was room to doubt Squire’s success in the early days. However, there is always room to doubt the success of early-stage ventures—indeed Jesse Middleton, WeWork cofounder and Squire’s first angel investor, says in the case (p. 4), “[W]hen you’re investing in early-stage prototypes, you look for one or two reasons to invest, not the hundreds of reasons not to.” And as for Salvant’s assessment of the causes of Squire’s early\\nSource: \"LTV 2022 Slack.docx - 99/214\"\\nfew investors would have known that was possible (founders included). And in this case, did Squire get lucky? Which early-stage investor would have betted that these founders would have been able to get such loyal customers and get so much revenue in a fairly unproven business model?The fact that early-stage investing is not clear cut with few indicators is probably why so many VC funds look to others for validation and signaling and explains why within 7mo a company can get a 5x step-up in valuation. I struggled with the fact that one person / fund can change the trajectory of the business and if they had not received any initial funding – where would the business be today? How much of a startup’s success is based on the founder pedigree and ability to fundraise vs. the actual business? I wonder if there is a way to neutralize biases (especially when it is done at a widescale level) – perhaps through more standardized data and sharing around valuations and metrics? How has the industry worked to rectify systematic biases since this case was written? Also, I would love to talk more about how VC funds think about sharing allocation and looking to other funds for signals – has this led to successful outcomes?

Another business issue that investors might raise to Squire came from the discussion of different barbershop business models on case pp. 4-6. Squire did not work well for barbers who used the common rent-a-chair business model (case p. 6). In addition, to ensure the greatest customer satisfaction and engagement with Squire, the company required barbershops to stop using other booking or payments systems they had in place. This allowed Squire to deeply embed its product in barbershops’ workflows but could be a barrier to adoption for some shops, especially shops that were not run by tech-savvy owners or did not serve a tech-savvy clientele. Salvant and LaRon also faced early struggles to find tech talent and to build their product. The two founders were first-timers with zero entrepreneurial experience, lacked tech experience and expertise, and their early attempts to hire developers all failed. One developer was a known conman who tried to steal their money (case p. 3). Although they probably did not reveal that mistake to investors, many investors prefer at least one member of a founding team to have product development experience. Students may also raise the challenging unit economics, on the surface. Those unit economics may come up at this point in the discussion (see below) or later when the instructor asks for a more detailed assessment of the quality of the business model (below).\\n',\n",

Initially, investors questioned the total addressable market (TAM) and did not see the potential for growth in the vertical SaaS industry, particularly in the SMB vertical SaaS sector.

Maintaining fiscal and operational oversight would become more important with a team expansion, and the increasing number of paid users across a growing number of pricing tiers also led to higher complexity internally. Students may dismiss the opportunity to invest in finance and operations, though, citing Straschnov’s business background and the still relatively small team. Conclusion (5 minutes) Leave time at the end of class to wrap up unresolved discussion points. Students should leave class with a firm understanding of the various considerations that go into whether to bootstrap or whether to seek outside funding—among them, the competitive outlook, investor attitudes, technical demands, a company’s business model and growth strategy, and the urgency of hiring needs. The instructor may also share post-case events. The founders used the investment interest to catalyze a $6.25 million seed round in June 2019. After investing in product and community—not yet sales—for a few years, the company then raised an extraordinary $100 million Series A round in July 2021 and has since begun to invest more in sales and marketing. Suggestions for Online Learning The following plan provides suggestions to enrich discussion and student engagement when teaching the case in an online session. Suggestions are organized by discussion pasture and refer to online meeting tools such as breakout rooms, yes/no polls, and screen shares. Pasture\\n\\nSource: \"Everlywell Teaching Plan.docx - 15/20\"\\nin the space (case p. 9). If you are teaching the case online, consider splitting students into pairs using the breakout rooms feature so that all the students can participate in the role-play exercise. To press this point a bit further, the instructor can ask students how they will address the issue with another group of stakeholders: employees. Cheek has decided to give $1 million to independent labs equipped to manufacture a COVID-19 test kit for at-home collection (case p. 11). Ask students, “You’ve just frozen your hiring, layoffs may be next, and now you want to give some of your precious capital away to third-party labs. How will that be perceived internally?” Most students believe employees will understand the financial pressures and will want to help out. Others, though, may feel like the company’s primary obligation is to its employees. If time allows, ask for two volunteers to role-play a conversation between Cheek and an employee who fears being laid off. Ask the student playing Cheek to summarize the key points she would include in a speech outlining Everlywell’s strategy for employees. Ask, “How would you motivate your team?” Once she has laid out a few talking points, ask the student playing the employee to respond with their concerns.

Discussion Plan Before students arrive, set up your board with the numbered subject headings found on the Board Plan on page 10.  Early Feedback (20 minutes) Open the discussion with an analysis of early signs of product-market fit for the Classtivity search engine. Review the events that brought Classtivity to this point: admission to the selective Techstars accelerator, investor backing, enthusiastic press coverage in TechCrunch and other publications (case p. 4-5). Invite students to evaluate feedback from sources internal and external to the market and record responses on Board 1. Ask, “What were the data telling Classtivity—do they indicate success, or do they present false positives?” Students may observe that: The search engine garnered significant press when it launched (case p. 4). Investors praised the large market opportunity, and said the marketplace was ripe for innovation (case p. 4). By late 2012, the site attracted 10,000 unique visitors every month (case p. 5).  However, actual customer traction was weak. Despite solid site traffic, users booked a total of 50 classes by the end of 2012, representing a very modest $750 in revenue (case p. 5).

Do you hope to pursue a role as a founder, a joiner, or an investor? Please note your response to this reflection, and to other reflections throughout the course, will be visible to your peers in this cohort. We encourage you to read and comment on your peers’ responses whenever possible. Our hope is you will find each other to be valuable thought partners and reliable sources of support throughout this course. In some instances—primarily those involving reflections about your own startup idea—your responses will remain private. Private reflections will be designated as such and will not be shared with your peers. At the end of the course, you will have the opportunity to download a PDF collection of your responses to a selection of reflections and other activities throughout the modules. Note: Skipping questions by providing cursory responses, entering filler text, or plagiarizing the work of others is regarded as incomplete participation in the course and will render you ineligible for a Certificate of Completion. If you are unsure of the answer, respond to the best of your ability while outlining the thought process behind your answer.

We will frequently ask you to\\n\\nSource: \"On the Bubble Teaching Note.docx - 14/22\"\\nmore expensive than inferior products (case p. 5). Maintaining fiscal and operational oversight would become more important with a team expansion, and the increasing number of paid users across a growing number of pricing tiers also led to higher complexity internally. Students may dismiss the opportunity to invest in finance and operations, though, citing Straschnov’s business background and the still relatively small team. Conclusion (5 minutes) Leave time at the end of class to wrap up unresolved discussion points. Students should leave class with a firm understanding of the various considerations that go into whether to bootstrap or whether to seek outside funding—among them, the competitive outlook, investor attitudes, technical demands, a company’s business model and growth strategy, and the urgency of hiring needs. The instructor may also share post-case events. The founders used the investment interest to catalyze a $6.25 million seed round in June 2019. After investing in product and community—not yet sales—for a few years, the company then raised an extraordinary $100 million Series A round in July 2021 and has since begun to invest more in sales and marketing. Suggestions for Online Learning The following plan provides suggestions to enrich discussion and student engagement when teaching the case in an online session. Suggestions are organized by discussion pasture and refer to online meeting tools such as breakout rooms, yes/no polls, and screen shares. Pasture\\n\\nSource: \"Everlywell Teaching Plan.docx - 15/20\"\\nin the space (case p. 9). If you are teaching the case online, consider splitting students into pairs using the breakout rooms feature so that all the students can participate in the role-play exercise. To press this point a bit further, the instructor can ask students how they will address the issue with another group of stakeholders: employees. Cheek has decided to give $1 million to independent labs equipped to manufacture a COVID-19 test kit for at-home collection (case p. 11). Ask students, “You’ve just frozen your hiring, layoffs may be next, and now you want to give some of your precious capital away to third-party labs. How will that be perceived internally?” Most students believe employees will understand the financial pressures and will want to help out. Others, though, may feel like the company’s primary obligation is to its employees. If time allows, ask for two volunteers to role-play a conversation between Cheek and an employee who fears being laid off. Ask the student playing Cheek to summarize the key points she would include in a speech outlining Everlywell’s strategy for employees. Ask, “How would you motivate your team?” Once she has laid out a few talking points, ask the student playing the employee to respond with their concerns. Regulatory Uncertainty (20 minutes) This last section of the teaching plan addresses the final decision described in the case: How should Cheek react to the FDA’s announcement that at-home tests for COVID-19 are not authorized\\n\\nSource: \"Classtivity Teaching Plan.docx - 4/21\"\\nRoadmap for Discussion 20 minutes\\tEvaluate Classtivity’s early market tests and feedback.  25 minutes\\tAnalyze the user economics of a subscription model. 25 minutes\\tDebate the merits of a soft or hard pivot to a subscription model. 10 minutes\\tConclude with case takeaways. Discussion Plan Before students arrive, set up your board with the numbered subject headings found on the Board Plan on page 10.  Early Feedback (20 minutes) Open the discussion with an analysis of early signs of product-market fit for the Classtivity search engine. Review the events that brought Classtivity to this point: admission to the selective Techstars accelerator, investor backing, enthusiastic press coverage in TechCrunch and other publications (case p. 4-5). Invite students to evaluate feedback from sources internal and external to the market and record responses on Board 1. Ask, “What were the data telling Classtivity—do they indicate success, or do they present false positives?” Students may observe that: The search engine garnered significant press when it launched (case p. 4). Investors praised the large market opportunity, and said the marketplace was ripe for innovation (case p. 4). By late 2012, the site attracted 10,000 unique visitors every month (case p. 5).  However, actual customer traction was weak. Despite solid site traffic, users booked a total of 50 classes by the end of 2012, representing a very modest $750 in revenue (case p. 5). Techstars and other third parties have elevated\\n\\nSource: \"ZappRx Teaching Plan.docx - 23/23\"\\napproaches to deepening students’ comprehension of business issues and energizing classroom discussion.

Operating in a fast-moving, competitive market, KhataBook could focus on customer acquisition, customer retention, or running a series of monetization experiments. Since its launch in 2018, KhataBook had raised $26.7 million through seed funding and a Series A round. By executing on product-led growth techniques, the startup had grown rapidly as measured by downloads and transactions. Yet, it had not generated any revenues or even determined its ultimate business model. After background on the rapid growth of internet accessibility and smartphone usage in India, as well as the digitization of services for merchants and shopkeepers—namely among small retail shops known in India as kirana shops—the case explores Naresh’s early career. Naresh took part in several startups\\n\\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 12/20\"\\nuse the app to take and receive orders with other users. They, in turn, may then begin using KhataBook’s bookkeeping features. Likewise, the overall retention rate could increase, as new users that downloaded the app for the bookkeeping function could stick with the app if it added e-commerce features. Pasture Two: Bottom of the Pyramid (20 minutes) Transition to the second pasture with an assessment of KhataBook’s existing market. Ask: Why is KhataBook a real opportunity in 2019 versus five years ago? Students should refer to Case pp. 2-3, noting that digital adoption lagged among KhataBook’s target customers, kirana shop owners, and other small business owners. However, the explosive growth of internet use in India due to declining smartphone prices and increased online penetration driven by Reliance Jio had seen an increase in digitalization of merchant and financial services.  Follow up, asking students a more provocative question, Can you build a big business at the bottom of the pyramid? Or are KhataBook’s target customers willing to use a free app but do not value the service enough to have a strong willingness to pay (WTP), lifetime value (LTV), and thus total addressable market (TAM)? Record responses on the board, as displayed on Board Three in Board Plan, p. 10. Responses may include: Yes.

Consider referencing Tavel’s Hierarchy of Engagement, as displayed on Board One in Board Plan, p. 10, from Sarah Tavel’s framework to evaluate non-transactional consumer companies and the importance of getting users to perform the core action—that is, the essence or foundation of the product and its value proposition. In the case of KhataBook, the core action is for a merchant to use the app to record a transaction with another merchant, which, if done correctly, can kick off a viral loop as the receiving merchant must get the app to receive the information electronically. Next, the class can discuss monetization experiments that founders run to test different aspects of their business model and the timing of those experiments. To contrast the forthcoming discussion of KhataBook, review examples of startups that faced less pressure from investors to monetize. For example, investors of Codecademy, an online platform offering coding classes, were supportive of Codecademy strategically delaying monetization experiments.

In addition, the material has been used successfully in a variety of executive programs for entrepreneurs interested in launching new businesses and for business owners who are interested in transforming an established business. Discussion Points/Questions Suggestions for how instructors can teach the key topics explored in this note are provided. We give a few discussion questions that can form the basis for pre-class assignments or in-class discussions. Of course, if a case accompanies the reading, then the primary assignment should revolve around that case, and the respective teaching note will provide guidance on that point. Appendix 1 provides a sample syllabus for a module on this topic, and Appendix 2 provides a list of cases and readings that can be used to enable students to understand how to recognize opportunities and how to use business-model analytics to shape those opportunities into ones that can be implemented in the marketplace. VC Background What are the key distinguishing features of venture capital as a financing source? This first section of the reading provides an opportunity to\\n\\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 4/20\"\\nstrategy, including virality and a user experience that drives repeated usage. The criticality of the quality of growth, not just quantity. Adding users that disengage shortly after product trial leads to a “leaky bucket” phenomenon. This case pushes students to look beyond headling-grabbing, “vanity metrics” and understand the underlying usage metrics that drive loyalty and value. Reinforce the concept that startups are experimentation machines and a founder’s choice of experiments is a strategic one. Startup experiments occur within an envelope of time and money and, thus, the sequencing of the experiments—in this case growth then usage then monetization—is critical. As it is set in India, this case also provides students with a vehicle to explore the different rules and playbooks that founders face in developing countries. For example, using capital as a competitive weapon and securing funding from one of the few large capital providers is even more critical than in a developed country where capital and prospective investors are more abundant. Finally, KhataBook describes a founder who pushes the limits of aggressive competition and ethical behavior—copying a peer’s concept, using images without permission in marketing campaigns, trying to steal away a competitor’s funding. Thus, the case provides a platform to discuss the boundaries of ethics in entrepreneurship. Assignment Questions How would you characterize KhataBook’s approach to monetization?

Khatabook can generate a lot of value for creditors by both being able to provide access to underserved mom and pop stores across rural India, and also having the data to filter/identify those most suitable for credit. Capturing a share of the value thus created for creditors opens up a viable monetization opportunity.

I came to the class thinking that Khatabook has a bleak chance to survive, because of a) low WTP for anything amongst shopkeepers (my Dad is a Kirana shop owner in India!), b) huge competition in lending services as\\xa0@Raghav Gupta\\xa0 mentioned and c) lack of high quality data to underwrite risk. However, I was surprised by a few milestones Khatabook has achieved post the case - supported 10M merchants through the pandemic, currently operating at 600K monthly app installs all through the WOM (seriously!!), Ravish’s fundraising ability (raised >175M$ now) for Khatabook. Overall, it looks like a VC money fueled product growth, but the sustainability story is yet to be told. There are still huge risks for the business. Ravish mentioned, during the coffee chat that he’s calibrating his mindset to build a business (he’s built products last 15 years but not business).

Could you also provide as much detail as possible?\\nHuman: Tips: Make sure to answer in the correct format.',\n",
       "  'answer': \"The Khatabook case presents several key issues. The first is the company's approach to monetization. As a digital ledger app for small businesses, KhataBook has focused on user acquisition and retention, but has not yet generated any revenues or determined its ultimate business model. The company has been running a series of monetization experiments, but the timing and nature of these experiments are critical strategic decisions. \\n\\nThe second issue is the company's operating environment. KhataBook operates at the 'bottom of the pyramid', serving small retail shops known as kirana shops in India. The rapid growth of internet use and smartphone adoption in India has created opportunities for digital services for these merchants, but there are questions about whether a big business can be built in this space, given the low willingness to pay and lifetime value of these customers.\\n\\nThe third issue is the ethical choices of the company's founders. The case describes instances of aggressive competition and questionable ethical behavior, such as copying a peer's concept, using images without permission in marketing campaigns, and attempting to steal a competitor's funding.\\n\\nIn terms of the assignment questions, KhataBook's approach to monetization can be characterized as experimental and evolving. The company is testing different aspects of its business model to find the most effective way to generate revenue. Comparing KhataBook's monetization timing situation to other startups, it seems that KhataBook is under more pressure to monetize, whereas some startups, like Codecademy, have had the luxury of delaying monetization with the support of their investors. \\n\\nAs for the monetization experiments that Naresh should run, one possibility could be to explore e-commerce features or lending services, leveraging the data they have on merchants to underwrite risk. However, these are just educated guesses based on the information provided.\\n\\nRegarding Naresh's choices and actions to date, comfort levels may vary depending on individual perspectives on ethical boundaries in entrepreneurship. Some may view his actions as aggressive but necessary in a competitive market, while others may see them as crossing ethical lines. Whether one would make similar decisions or work for someone who made similar decisions would also depend on individual values and perspectives.\",\n",

Consider referencing Tavel’s Hierarchy of Engagement, as displayed on Board One in Board Plan, p. 10, from Sarah Tavel’s framework to evaluate non-transactional consumer companies and the importance of getting users to perform the core action—that is, the essence or foundation of the product and its value proposition. In the case of KhataBook, the core action is for a merchant to use the app to record a transaction with another merchant, which, if done correctly, can kick off a viral loop as the receiving merchant must get the app to receive the information electronically. Next, the class can discuss monetization experiments that founders run to test different aspects of their business model and the timing of those experiments. To contrast the forthcoming discussion of KhataBook, review examples of startups that faced less pressure from investors to monetize. For example, investors of Codecademy, an online platform offering coding classes, were supportive of Codecademy strategically delaying monetization experiments. KhataBook, on the other hand,\\n\\nSource: \"ENTRE_M4_BV3_2.13.2023_READY FOR BETA.docx - 69/88\"\\n<Header> Reminder tips for Team Discussions: 1.

See the sample syllabus in Appendixes 1 for details on sequencing of material and Appendix 2 for possible cases. III. Level  The target audience for this reading and the associated cases are undergraduates, MBAs, or master’s students considering an entrepreneurial career. In addition, the material has been used successfully in a variety of executive programs for entrepreneurs interested in launching new businesses and for business owners who are interested in transforming an established business. Discussion Points/Questions Suggestions for how instructors can teach the key topics explored in this note are provided. We give a few discussion questions that can form the basis for pre-class assignments or in-class discussions. Of course, if a case accompanies the reading, then the primary assignment should revolve around that case, and the respective teaching note will provide guidance on that point. Appendix 1 provides a sample syllabus for a module on this topic, and Appendix 2 provides a list of cases and readings that can be used to enable students to understand how to recognize opportunities and how to use business-model analytics to shape those opportunities into ones that can be implemented in the marketplace. VC Background What are the key distinguishing features of venture capital as a financing source? This first section of the reading provides an opportunity to\\n\\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 4/20\"\\nstrategy, including virality and a user experience that drives repeated usage. The criticality of the quality of growth, not just quantity. Adding users that disengage shortly after product trial leads to a “leaky bucket” phenomenon. This case pushes students to look beyond headling-grabbing, “vanity metrics” and understand the underlying usage metrics that drive loyalty and value. Reinforce the concept that startups are experimentation machines and a founder’s choice of experiments is a strategic one. Startup experiments occur within an envelope of time and money and, thus, the sequencing of the experiments—in this case growth then usage then monetization—is critical. As it is set in India, this case also provides students with a vehicle to explore the different rules and playbooks that founders face in developing countries. For example, using capital as a competitive weapon and securing funding from one of the few large capital providers is even more critical than in a developed country where capital and prospective investors are more abundant. Finally, KhataBook describes a founder who pushes the limits of aggressive competition and ethical behavior—copying a peer’s concept, using images without permission in marketing campaigns, trying to steal away a competitor’s funding. Thus, the case provides a platform to discuss the boundaries of ethics in entrepreneurship. Assignment Questions How would you characterize KhataBook’s approach to monetization? Compare KhataBook’s\\n\\nSource: \"LTV 2022 Slack.docx - 74/214\"\\nup a self-generating flywheel. Khatabook can generate a lot of value for creditors by both being able to provide access to underserved mom and pop stores across rural India, and also having the data to filter/identify those most suitable for credit. Capturing a share of the value thus created for creditors opens up a viable monetization opportunity. Would love to hear others’ perspectives. 3 replies Last reply 7 months agoView thread Saurabh Gupta\\xa0\\xa05:45 PM Hi team, sharing my reflections from today’s discussion and from the coffee chat with Ravish later today. I came to the class thinking that Khatabook has a bleak chance to survive, because of a) low WTP for anything amongst shopkeepers (my Dad is a Kirana shop owner in India!), b) huge competition in lending services as\\xa0@Raghav Gupta\\xa0 mentioned and c) lack of high quality data to underwrite risk. However, I was surprised by a few milestones Khatabook has achieved post the case - supported 10M merchants through the pandemic, currently operating at 600K monthly app installs all through the WOM (seriously!!), Ravish’s fundraising ability (raised >175M$ now) for Khatabook. Overall, it looks like a VC money fueled product growth, but the sustainability story is yet to be told. There are still huge risks for the business. Ravish mentioned, during the coffee chat that he’s calibrating his mindset to build a business (he’s built products last 15 years but not business). Khatabook is still building human capital in the org to build',\n",

Dilution. Or as industry insiders call it, “taking a haircut.” Everybody knows that when you raise money at a startup your ownership percentage of the company goes down. The goal is to have the value of the startup go up by enough that you own a smaller percentage of a much larger business and therefore your total personal value goes up. The simplest way to think about this is: If you own 20% of a $2 million company your stake is worth $400,000. If you raise a new round venture capital (say $2.5 million at a $7.5 million pre-money valuation, which is a $10 million post-money) you get diluted by 25% (2.5m / 10m). So you own 15% of the new company but that 15% is now worth $1.5 million or a gain of $1.1 million. But understanding how you’re likely to get diluted over time is a more difficult concept. And figuring out how much your equity may be worth over the course of a 5-year stint at a startup is even more complicated. I’ve had to simplify a bit, but to make it easier to understand I’ve teamed up with Jess Bachman at Visual.ly. If you want to see a view of the power of their work check out this Steve Jobs infographic. I’m a huge believer in Info Graphics and the ability to create deeper understanding of complicated topics through visual means. As “Big Data” becomes more pervasive the power to visualize will become increasingly important. And Jess is awesome at his trade.

That rule isn’t precise—perhaps you might push it to 25% or even 30% in some cases if you are really keen on the money and the financial partner, but generally this “rule of 20” holds. This matrix is a planning tool to help founders think through not only the amount of money you want (the x axis) but the implications on the dilution based on the valuation (the y axis) and the threshold beyond which you want to avoid. Thus, if the Chief founders really want to raise $20 million and execute on their more aggressive expansion plans, they need to convince investors that they are worth $100 million in post-money valuation in order to avoid violating the rule of 20% and suffering too much dilution at the series A—a tall order!

The second investor gets 2x more shares (50% discount).

VCs in early stage round assume that you will likely take 20–25% dilution for your funding round so if you’re raising $8–10 million they will assume your expectation is $24 million pre at the low-end of the range ($8m x 4 = $32m post money with $8m capital injected buying 25% of the company) and $40 million pre at the high end ($10m x 5= $50m post money with $10m capital injected buying 20% or $40m pre). So when you say $8–10m is your goal and you aren’t at all thinking about your valuation know that a VC hears “$24–40 million pre-money valuation expectations.” Of course there are times where 15% dilution is more appropriate and other times it can be 33% but in a first meeting we’re just trying to establish general ranges for reasonableness. If you’ve only ever raised $500k, have limited revenue, have 7 people at your company and aren’t a serial entrepreneur it’s a pretty tall order to imagine going straight to $8–10 million unless your data is very compelling or you’ve otherwise become “hot.” If you’ve raised $3 million previously, have $250k in monthly recurring revenue and 23 staff an $8–10 million round might be more down the fairway.\\n\\nSource: \"ENTRE_M3_BV3_05_17_2023 Jeff W1 Changes.docx - 69/120\"\\nquickly?            Your Response Benefits Risks Teaching Element: Faculty Video_Dilution & Protagonist Video_Dilution_Kaplan [3.2.3 Faculty & Protagonist Video: Dilution] <Header 2> How much money should I raise? Jeff Bussgang Determining the right amount of capital to raise is a function of a few factors that we have covered: First, what stage you are at with your venture and where you are in the product-market fit journey Second, how much time do you need to achieve the next major milestones that will get you to the next valuation inflection points. Finally, what will it cost you in terms of operating expenses and net cash outflows to run the company and the associated experiments for that amount of time? Add 3-6 months of cushion for failed experiments, iterations, and fundraising and you get to the amount of money you need to raise. In the case of Chief, they had two options and two different operating plans. These options are informed by (1) the likelihood that you can execute your plan; (2) the likelihood that you can raise the amount of money desired; and (3) the cost of capital in the form of dilution. Let’s talk more about dilution in detail. Dilution is a function of the amount of capital you raise and your post-money valuation. For example, if Chief were to raise $5M on a $50M post-money valuation, they are selling 10% of the company and thus diluting themselves by 10%.

       "  'answer': \"Equity dilution over time can vary greatly depending on the number of funding rounds and the amount of capital raised in each round. However, there are some general rules of thumb. For instance, in each round of financing, it's typical to avoid selling more than 20% of your company, which means you could expect around 20% dilution per round. However, this can sometimes be pushed to 25% or even 30% in some cases. It's also important to note that the dilution is a function of the amount of capital you raise and your post-money valuation. For example, if you were to raise $5M on a $50M post-money valuation, you would be selling 10% of the company and thus diluting yourself by 10%.

Your Response Benefits Risks Teaching Element: Faculty Video_Dilution & Protagonist Video_Dilution_Kaplan [3.2.3 Faculty & Protagonist Video: Dilution] <Header 2> How much money should I raise? Jeff Bussgang Determining the right amount of capital to raise is a function of a few factors that we have covered: First, what stage you are at with your venture and where you are in the product-market fit journey Second, how much time do you need to achieve the next major milestones that will get you to the next valuation inflection points. Finally, what will it cost you in terms of operating expenses and net cash outflows to run the company and the associated experiments for that amount of time? Add 3-6 months of cushion for failed experiments, iterations, and fundraising and you get to the amount of money you need to raise. In the case of Chief, they had two options and two different operating plans. These options are informed by (1) the likelihood that you can execute your plan; (2) the likelihood that you can raise the amount of money desired; and (3) the cost of capital in the form of dilution. Let’s talk more about dilution in detail. Dilution is a function of the amount of capital you raise and your post-money valuation. For example, if Chief were to raise $5M on a $50M post-money valuation, they are selling 10% of the company and thus diluting themselves by 10%.  When the Chief founders mapped out their two plans and the operating expenses required to',\n",

However, it is generally suggested that advisors, who typically contribute less value than directors, should receive a lower equity grant. A common suggestion is an annual grant of 25% to 50% of the four-year grant you'd give a junior engineer. This would equate to 1x - 2x a junior engineer's grant if the advisor stays engaged for four years.

Instead, given the facts I was given, my feedback was to run far away, fast. Entrepreneurs – beware. This is the kind of behavior that gives investors a bad name.

People do what people do. You have money, you spend it. And there are consequences for spending too much money. I was always fond of saying about fund raising, “When the hor d’oeuvres tray is passed take two and put one in your pocket for later. Just don’t take the whole tray.” My analogy was that there are markets where it’s relatively easier to raise capital and therefore you should take a little bit more but you should create a budget where you only spend 70% of what you raise on a pace of 18 months. But people never do. Justin is right. I know it sounds crazy but at the earliest stages of a company your valuation often is determined by how much money you raise. There is a general guideline of how much investors want to own in order to invest in your company and the norm is 15–30% with the most common range 20–25% per early stage round. So the temptation would be to ask for $5 million because that implies a $20 million pre-money valuation if you’re able to only give away 20% or a $15 million pre-money valuation of investors require 25%. A $15–20 million valuation sounds better than an $8 million valuation, doesn’t it? It seems almost silly to argue that it’s better to have an $8 million valuation. But it’s actually not that silly.\\n\\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2006/05/how-many-stock-options-should-i-give-an-advisor/\"\\nUsually, you’ll be granting stock options (non-qualified stock options – “non-quals” or NQSO’s) to the advisor.\\xa0 As a result you should think through vesting carefully.\\xa0 Many advisors contribute much of their value early in the life of the relationship so rather than giving a grant that vests over four years, you might consider making an annual grant and then revisiting things in a year to see if the relationship is living up to expectations.\\xa0 A savvy advisor will prefer to get a bigger grant that vests over four years since it will allow them to lock in a strike price at today’s fair market value (FMV) of the stock (which – in the success case – will likely be lower than the FMV in the future).\\xa0 At the minimum, this will facilitate a conversation about revisiting things annually to make sure everyone’s expectation is being met with the relationship.\\n\\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2006/05/how-many-stock-options-should-i-give-an-advisor/\"\\nI received the following question recently: Just want to ask you a question.

I was thinking of 100,000 shares each that equates to 1% company equity. Can you advice me on what’s the norm? 1% is rich.\\xa0 In the past, I’ve given some ground rules for equity grants for directors – 1% vesting over four years is at the top end of the range.\\xa0 Advisors typically (although not always) contribute much less value to a company than directors and their equity grant should correspondingly be less.\\xa0 Of course, the amount you give depends on a number of factors, including things like your expectation of what the advisor will provide, how much you value this involvement, and the existing capital structure of the company (e.g. larger grants if you are younger, smaller grants if you are a more mature company.)\\n\\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2011/07/finance-fridays-getting-started-allocating-equity-and-founders-investment/\"\\nJane indicated that the most she could invest in the company before they would have to seek other sources of capital was $50k. Dick hated to think that he would be diluted by more than 20% of his stake over $50k and proposed that Jane receive 10% incremental equity for her $50k. Jane felt comfortable with receiving 10% for $50k, but no less, so they agreed on a $450k pre money valuation of their startup. There are a number of ways Jane and Dick could have executed the equity transaction. The simplest would be if they agreed in the founders documents that they would both commit full-time to the business, Jane would contribute an initial $50k, and they would split the equity 55/45 in favor of Jane. Dick and Jane have now successfully navigated their first finance challenge: dividing up the founders’ equity, including an investment from one of the founders. A few key lessons from today’s post are: Next week, we will address how Jane and Dick put proper accounting systems in place. Oh, and you’ll notice that they don’t yet have a name for their company. They’ve told us they are open to suggestions.\\n\\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2011/07/finance-fridays-getting-started-allocating-equity-and-founders-investment/\"\\nJane and Dick had several options, including structuring this as a debt transaction where Jane simply loaned the money to the company, or as convertible debt transaction where Jane’s investment would convert into equity in the next round. But they worried that future investors would frown on that or wouldn’t give Jane credit for the investment at a later date, since they might consider it as part of Jane’s contribution to her original ownership position of 50%. That narrowed the possibilities down to an equity transaction, which would in turn require a conversation about valuation. Jane and Dick briefly considered a valuation based on the next external financing round, perhaps applying a discount. For example, if the first round of external investment values the company at $2 million post and, prior to that, Jane had invested $50,000, then with no discount, Jane’s investment would earn her 2.5% of the company ($50k/$2M = 2.5%). If they agreed on a 20% discount, then Jane would be entitled to 3.125% of the company ($2M * (1-20% discount) = $1.6M; $50k/$1.6M = 3.125%). At this stage it wasn’t clear when (or even if) the first round of external financing might occur or what it might look like, which made agreeing on a discount just as difficult as agreeing on a valuation, while adding complexity. After a tense conversation about this, Jane and Dick decided to go out for a beer and try to resolve the equity allocation issue once and for all.\\n\\nSource: \"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/raising-angel-money-cc9f8ab923b6\"\\nAs an entrepreneur you should raise money from the most experienced people possible — period. If you have the opportunity to raise a small amount of money from a group of experienced investors who have a track record of helping companies get from that tricky idea stage to being a well-formed company with a good product and solid market-entry strategy I would take the money — even if it were priced. Worrying about giving up an extra 10% of your company at this stage can be meaningless if the ultimate outcome is either success or failure. Even VC’s think this way, which is why Fred Wilson when describing his decision to syndicate a portion of his invesment in GeoCities to another investor says, “I learned that good partners are worth every penny of returns you give up to get them.” (whole article here if you’re interested) Don’t worry about getting “screwed” by sage angel investors. If they really are well regarded and serial investors they won’t likely screw you. Why? Because if they try to take 50% of your company for $500,000 then they know it will be very hard to raise VC because we’ll know that too much of the value has been taken away from the founders before our investment.

Incoming into a VC fixer-upper you often have leverage over personal compensationIn Ian’s post he rightly points out that stepping into a role with $15 million in paid-in capital that has already been spent can be a problem. This is because this “liquidation preference” gets returned to investors before you see any money — restricting the executive outcomes in mid-sized exits. But when the VC is looking for somebody willing to take on a project with a bit of hair, you actually have more leverage than you think (precisely because many people won’t take on that assignment). So you may — for example — ask for a deal in your contract that guarantees you will get a minimum of $500,000 on any sale or you may agree that your stock is exited “pari passu” with the existing liquidation preferences or that management is guaranteed a minimum bonus of $2 million on any exit (that you share with your other execs).

If you’re a later-stage fund that comes in when there’s less upside but a lower “loss ratio” you might have only 8–12 investments in a fund.

If you’re a later-stage fund that comes in when there’s less upside but a lower “loss ratio” you might have only 8–12 investments in a fund. If you’re an angel investor you should figure out how much money you can afford to lose and then figure out how to pace your money over a set period of time (say 2–3 years) and come up with how many companies you think is diversified for you and then back into how many $ to write / company. Hint: don’t do only 2–3 deals!! Many angels I know have signed over more than their comfort level in just 12 months and then feel stuck. It can be years before you start seeing returns.

People do what people do. You have money, you spend it. And there are consequences for spending too much money. I was always fond of saying about fund raising, “When the hor d’oeuvres tray is passed take two and put one in your pocket for later. Just don’t take the whole tray.” My analogy was that there are markets where it’s relatively easier to raise capital and therefore you should take a little bit more but you should create a budget where you only spend 70% of what you raise on a pace of 18 months. But people never do. Justin is right. I know it sounds crazy but at the earliest stages of a company your valuation often is determined by how much money you raise. There is a general guideline of how much investors want to own in order to invest in your company and the norm is 15–30% with the most common range 20–25% per early stage round. So the temptation would be to ask for $5 million because that implies a $20 million pre-money valuation if you’re able to only give away 20% or a $15 million pre-money valuation of investors require 25%. A $15–20 million valuation sounds better than an $8 million valuation, doesn’t it? It seems almost silly to argue that it’s better to have an $8 million valuation.

Dick hated to think that he would be diluted by more than 20% of his stake over $50k and proposed that Jane receive 10% incremental equity for her $50k. Jane felt comfortable with receiving 10% for $50k, but no less, so they agreed on a $450k pre money valuation of their startup. There are a number of ways Jane and Dick could have executed the equity transaction. The simplest would be if they agreed in the founders documents that they would both commit full-time to the business, Jane would contribute an initial $50k, and they would split the equity 55/45 in favor of Jane. Dick and Jane have now successfully navigated their first finance challenge: dividing up the founders’ equity, including an investment from one of the founders. A few key lessons from today’s post are: Next week, we will address how Jane and Dick put proper accounting systems in place. Oh, and you’ll notice that they don’t yet have a name for their company.

But they worried that future investors would frown on that or wouldn’t give Jane credit for the investment at a later date, since they might consider it as part of Jane’s contribution to her original ownership position of 50%. That narrowed the possibilities down to an equity transaction, which would in turn require a conversation about valuation. Jane and Dick briefly considered a valuation based on the next external financing round, perhaps applying a discount. For example, if the first round of external investment values the company at $2 million post and, prior to that, Jane had invested $50,000, then with no discount, Jane’s investment would earn her 2.5% of the company ($50k/$2M = 2.5%). If they agreed on a 20% discount, then Jane would be entitled to 3.125% of the company ($2M * (1-20% discount) = $1.6M; $50k/$1.6M = 3.125%). At this stage it wasn’t clear when (or even if) the first round of external financing might occur or what it might look like, which made agreeing on a discount just as difficult as agreeing on a valuation, while adding complexity.

If you have the opportunity to raise a small amount of money from a group of experienced investors who have a track record of helping companies get from that tricky idea stage to being a well-formed company with a good product and solid market-entry strategy I would take the money — even if it were priced. Worrying about giving up an extra 10% of your company at this stage can be meaningless if the ultimate outcome is either success or failure.

The instructor may wish to mention that the leader of the all-male firm was Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, who had prioritized diversity and inclusion throughout his career. The female-led firm was Inspired Capital, led by Penny Pritzker, the former Secretary of Commerce under President Barack Obama, and Alexa Von Tobel, the former founder and CEO of Learnvest. The instructor may then ask, “Given the team’s choice for the amount of capital they decided to raise, what are the implications for Chief moving forward?”  Student responses may include the following:  Chief needs to grow rapidly to justify the higher valuation implied by the amount of funding it had just raised. Childers and Kaplan must make significant progress with the company’s expansion and prove to investors that the market size justifies the amount of capital raised. Childers and Kaplan must prioritize building a management team that can support scaling.  The team must ensure that Chief crafts different customer acquisition and retention strategies according to different cities. The team should also be open to tailoring aspects of the product offering, such as the clubhouse or small group meeting structures, to best accommodate local dynamics. As they expand, Childers and Kaplan should be mindful of the unique city-by-city market dynamics.  Childers and Kaplan must create Chief’s digital platform to build a more scalable and holistic\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 32/37\"\\nefficiency in building start-ups. The more capital that is raised, the more is spent on marginal initiatives. Milestone-based financing with tighter milestones and smaller buffers may lead to more discipline. Again, students may cite examples of their own experiences or that of famous startups that saw false positives in product-market fit and then scaled too aggressively (e.g., Fab.com). The instructor should then present students with a hypothetical situation in which Childers decides to pursue a blitz strategy and receives two term sheets:  Option 1: A strong valuation from a top-tier firm that is all male Option 2: A lower valuation from a new firm that is female-led The instructor should emphasize that the price difference is significant, and ask students, “Which option would you pursue?” Record student responses on Board 7. Some students may argue that Childers and Kaplan should take the option from the male firm since, as a new business, Chief needs both the capital and the power of the firm’s reputation. Other students may counter that Chief has promoted itself as a company that is committed to female empowerment and that taking the investment from the all-male firm would damage Chief’s reputation.  Some students may argue that the decision would depend on the profiles of the women at the female-led firm and may point out that the female-led firm could present important networking and membership opportunities for Chief in the future. Other students may respond that\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 34/37\"\\nChief represents a highly sought-after investment opportunity. Thus, they have an opportunity to try to shape the negotiations such that the financing framework and participants precisely meet their needs rather than simply reacting to what investors want to do. Ultimately, founders must ensure that they have alignment between their customers, their value proposition, unit economics, branding, and their venture capital funding. All factors are interdependent and have an impact on the expansion potential and pacing of a company.   Wrap Up The instructor can then reveal which option Childers and Kaplan chose. The instructor should state that after generating a high degree of investor and member interest, they decided to blitzscale to other cities. The instructor may suggest that a possible motivating factor to support the blitzscale was the importance of first-mover advantage for securing Chief’s target audience in the new cities, given the limited market size and high switching costs associated with women’s executive networking.  The instructor may note that, in June 2019, Childers and Kaplan raised $22 million in funding, combining investments from an all-male firm and a female-led firm. As a result, Childers and Kaplan planned to expand to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., by December 2020. The instructor may wish to mention that the leader of the all-male firm was Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, who had prioritized\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 30/37\"\\nwould join. Each piece of the business model was interdependent.  Because of this, each new city presented a winner-take-all market: only one women’s professional networking organization was likely to thrive in any given place, because only one could have the best network of women.

Kaplan needed to weigh the risks and opportunities of joining Chief. Instructors can use these role materials as the basis of a negotiation exercise that focuses on the co-founder selection process. Key issues include understanding the factors that determine whether a co-founder is needed, what qualities to search for in a co-founder, and what topics need to be discussed when beginning a start-up venture together.  “Scaling at Chief” explores events after Childers and Kaplan launched Chief. The first Chief branch opened in New York City in January 2019 and experienced immediate success. More than 1,000 women joined the waitlist in October 2018, and the number of paid members exceeded Childers and Kaplan’s annual goal by February 2019. Childers and Kaplan initially planned to focus on the New York City branch for Chief’s first year, but given early indications of demand in other cities, they considered moving up their timeline for expansion and scaling more aggressively.

While expansion presented the opportunity to capitalize on Chief’s early momentum, Childers and Kaplan wondered whether to focus first on unfinished business in New York, such as filling key staff positions and building Chief’s technology platform. The technology platform would allow members to stay in touch between meetings, seek advice from the entire Chief network, and cultivate a stronger sense of community within Chief (case p. 5).

The female-led firm was Inspired Capital, led by Penny Pritzker, the former Secretary of Commerce under President Barack Obama, and Alexa Von Tobel, the former founder and CEO of Learnvest. The instructor may then ask, “Given the team’s choice for the amount of capital they decided to raise, what are the implications for Chief moving forward?”  Student responses may include the following:  Chief needs to grow rapidly to justify the higher valuation implied by the amount of funding it had just raised. Childers and Kaplan must make significant progress with the company’s expansion and prove to investors that the market size justifies the amount of capital raised. Childers and Kaplan must prioritize building a management team that can support scaling.  The team must ensure that Chief crafts different customer acquisition and retention strategies according to different cities. The team should also be open to tailoring aspects of the product offering, such as the clubhouse or small group meeting structures, to best accommodate local dynamics. As they expand, Childers and Kaplan should be mindful of the unique city-by-city market dynamics.  Childers and Kaplan must create Chief’s digital platform to build a more scalable and holistic\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 32/37\"\\nefficiency in building start-ups. The more capital that is raised, the more is spent on marginal initiatives. Milestone-based financing with tighter milestones and smaller buffers may lead to more discipline. Again, students may cite examples of their own experiences or that of famous startups that saw false positives in product-market fit and then scaled too aggressively (e.g., Fab.com). The instructor should then present students with a hypothetical situation in which Childers decides to pursue a blitz strategy and receives two term sheets:  Option 1: A strong valuation from a top-tier firm that is all male Option 2: A lower valuation from a new firm that is female-led The instructor should emphasize that the price difference is significant, and ask students, “Which option would you pursue?” Record student responses on Board 7. Some students may argue that life is funky and funny both at the same time. Other students may say that Chief has promoted itself as a company that is committed to female empowerment and that taking the investment from the all-male firm would damage Chief’s reputation.  Some students may argue that the decision would depend on the profiles of the women at the female-led firm and may point out that the female-led firm could present important networking and membership opportunities for Chief in the future. Other students may respond that\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 34/37\"\\nChief represents a highly sought-after investment opportunity. Thus, they have an opportunity to try to shape the negotiations such that the financing framework and participants precisely meet their needs rather than simply reacting to what investors want to do. Ultimately, founders must ensure that they have alignment between their customers, their value proposition, unit economics, branding, and their venture capital funding. All factors are interdependent and have an impact on the expansion potential and pacing of a company.   Wrap Up The instructor can then reveal which option Childers and Kaplan chose. The instructor should state that after generating a high degree of investor and member interest, they decided to blitzscale to other cities. The instructor may suggest that a possible motivating factor to support the blitzscale was the importance of first-mover advantage for securing Chief’s target audience in the new cities, given the limited market size and high switching costs associated with women’s executive networking.  The instructor may note that, in June 2019, Childers and Kaplan raised $22 million in funding, combining investments from an all-male firm and a female-led firm. As a result, Childers and Kaplan planned to expand to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., by December 2020.

Each piece of the business model was interdependent.  Because of this, each new city presented a winner-take-all market: only one women’s professional networking organization was likely to thrive in any given place, because only one could have the best network of women.

The team should also be open to tailoring aspects of the product offering, such as the clubhouse or small group meeting structures, to best accommodate local dynamics. As they expand, Childers and Kaplan should be mindful of the unique city-by-city market dynamics.  Childers and Kaplan must create Chief’s digital platform to build a more scalable and holistic\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 32/37\"\\nefficiency in building start-ups. The more capital that is raised, the more is spent on marginal initiatives. Milestone-based financing with tighter milestones and smaller buffers may lead to more discipline. Again, students may cite examples of their own experiences or that of famous startups that saw false positives in product-market fit and then scaled too aggressively (e.g., Fab.com). The instructor presented a situation in which the founders have to decide between a beach holiday and a mountain hiking trip: Option 1: A relaxing beach holiday with guaranteed sunshine and plenty of opportunities for leisure and relaxation, or Option 2: A challenging but potentially rewarding mountain hiking trip with unpredictable weather. The class was divided, with some students preferring the security and leisure of the beach holiday and others excited by the adventure and achievement potential of the mountain hike.  Some students may argue that the decision would depend on the profiles of the women at the female-led firm and may point out that the female-led firm could present important networking and membership opportunities for Chief in the future. Other students may respond that\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 34/37\"\\nChief represents a highly sought-after investment opportunity. Thus, they have an opportunity to try to shape the negotiations such that the financing framework and participants precisely meet their needs rather than simply reacting to what investors want to do. Ultimately, founders must ensure that they have alignment between their customers, their value proposition, unit economics, branding, and their venture capital funding. All factors are interdependent and have an impact on the expansion potential and pacing of a company.   Wrap Up The instructor can then reveal which option Childers and Kaplan chose. The instructor should state that after generating a high degree of investor and member interest, they decided to blitzscale to other cities. The instructor may suggest that a possible motivating factor to support the blitzscale was the importance of first-mover advantage for securing Chief’s target audience in the new cities, given the limited market size and high switching costs associated with women’s executive networking.  The instructor may note that, in June 2019, Childers and Kaplan raised $22 million in funding, combining investments from an all-male firm and a female-led firm. As a result, Childers and Kaplan planned to expand to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., by December 2020. The instructor may wish to mention that the leader of the all-male firm was Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, who had prioritized\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 30/37\"\\nwould join. Each piece of the business model was interdependent.  Because of this, each new city presented a winner-take-all market: only one women’s professional networking organization was likely to thrive in any given place, because only one could have the best network of women. This exacerbated the need for Chief to move quickly, lest other competitors captured the women-centric executive networking market first. On the other hand, rapid expansion might strain resources such that Chief would be unable to successfully acquire target customers in new cities.  At this point, the instructor may conclude the pasture by asking, “Have any of you changed your minds about your initial vote?” The instructor might ask respondents to explain what affected their opinions. Choosing the Right Amount of Capital—And the Right Capital Partner (15 minutes) The instructor should next shift to discuss the fundraising decision that Childers and Kaplan would face if they chose to expand. The instructor can show their decision map on Board 6, illustrating how much stake in Chief Childers and Kaplan would give up by raising different amounts of capital at varying valuations. While raising a large amount of capital gives a young company more resources, its existing owners must weigh how much ownership dilution they are willing to accept to accommodate new investors who contribute additional capital. The instructor might point out that delaying expansion would likely give Chief a higher valuation,\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 17/37\"\\nThere was a clear demand among female executives for the services that Chief provided. For example, Sujean Lee, the COO of Milk Bar, noted that her job “was such a rewarding professional experience, but it was also stressful and intense and at times lonely. I wished I had more people who understood what I was going through” (case p. 6). Of the available executive networking services and women-centric networking services, only Chief provided the support and camaraderie that Lee and her peers sought. These sentiments were likely universal among highly successful women and indicated that Chief would have significant demand in other cities. An important factor in the question of the pacing of expansion is access to capital. At this stage of the conversation, students may raise the fact that aggressive expansion would require a large and successful fundraising round(s). Chief was not a software-based startup with any intellectual property and thus may not be as attractive to venture capitalist funders. Further, Childers and Kaplan were first-time founders. Women have historically had a difficult time accessing venture capital to fuel their start-ups. Research has shown that female entrepreneurs are asked more “prevention-focused questions” that focus on not losing capital, while male entrepreneurs are given the chance to answer more “promotion-focused questions” that focus on attaining growth. Emerging evidence finds that these disparities are most pronounced in more\\n\\nSource: \"Chief 920021-PDF-ENG.pdf - Page 1\"\\nKATHERINE B. COFFMAN   JEFFREY J. BUSSGANG   KATHLEEN L. MCGINN   JULIA KELLEY   KATHERINE CHEN   Scaling at Chief   In late February  2019,  just months  after  their  network  for women  executives  offici ally launched,   Chief  co-founders  Carolyn Childers and Lindsay Kaplan  prepared  to meet  with  one of their  investors   in New York  City to talk about  their  financing  and operating  plans  for the coming  year. As they  waited   in Chief’s recently  renovated, members -only  Tribeca  Clubhouse,  the two co-founders  were amazed  by  how  much  they  had accomplished.  (See Exhibit 1 for photos  of Chief’s  Clubhouse.)   Childers and Kaplan  had first met to discuss Chief  in 2018.  Over  coffee, Childers shared her initial   vision  for Chie f, an organization  that would  provide  support  to women executives  at the vice president   (VP)  and C-suite  level.  She explained  how  the vast majority  of these  executives  had reached a stage  in  their  career where they  were more  isolated,  often as the only  woman  in the room.  (See Exhibit  2 for a  pitch  deck  slide  summarizing the reasons  for launching  Chief.)  This  experience was personal  for  Childers and Kaplan,  each  of whom had risen  to the senior  vice president  (SVP) level  in male - dominated  startups —Handy  and Casper, respectively. Childers  was in itially unsure  about whether   she should  launch Chief  alone  or with  a co-founder,  but Kaplan,  with  her brand  and marketing\\n\\nSource: \"ENTRE_M5_BV3_02.22.2023_READY FOR BETA.docx - 13/119\"\\nBusiness School, Mark Conley of Stockholm School of Economics, and E.

The researchers analyzed the question and answer interactions between VCs and entrepreneurs at a fundraising competition and then tracked the subsequent funding rounds for startups launched at the event. \"As the sun set, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, a young girl sat by the window, lost in the enchanting world of the book she was reading, oblivious to the world outside.\" is what one venture capitalist said to the other.

Kaplan needed to weigh the risks and opportunities of joining Chief. Instructors can use these role materials as the basis of a negotiation exercise that focuses on the co-founder selection process. Key issues include understanding the factors that determine whether a co-founder is needed, what qualities to search for in a co-founder, and what topics need to be discussed when beginning a start-up venture together.  “Scaling at Chief” explores events after Childers and Kaplan launched Chief. The first Chief branch opened in New York City in January 2019 and experienced immediate success. More than 1,000 women joined the waitlist in October 2018, and the number of paid members exceeded Childers and Kaplan’s annual goal by February 2019. Childers and Kaplan initially planned to focus on the New York City branch for Chief’s first year, but given early indications of demand in other cities, they considered moving up their timeline for expansion and scaling more aggressively.  At the end of the “Scaling at Chief” case, Childers and Kaplan had to decide appropriate next steps for Chief. They could undertake a moderate strategy in which they raise a modest amount of capital and expand to two additional cities, Boston and Washington, DC; they could raise a larger amount of capital and\\n\\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 3/37\"\\nThey could undertake a moderate strategy in which they raise a modest amount of capital and expand to two additional cities, Boston and Washington, DC; they could raise a larger amount of capital and aggressively expand to five cities by adding Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco; or they could pursue their original plan to focus exclusively on New York City to develop their nascent offering and operations and avoid the distraction of fundraising altogether. While expansion presented the opportunity to capitalize on Chief’s early momentum, Childers and Kaplan wondered whether to focus first on unfinished business in New York, such as filling key staff positions and building Chief’s technology platform. The technology platform would allow members to stay in touch between meetings, seek advice from the entire Chief network, and cultivate a stronger sense of community within Chief (case p. 5). Childers and Kaplan also needed to determine how to mitigate the operational and quality risks involved with a more rapid expansion.   Instructors can use this collection of cases to illustrate the decision points that a young company faces. First, how does one identify the right co-founder, and what are best practices for negotiating with a potential co-founder? After early successes, what should founders factor into strategic and operational decisions about growth? What factors should be given weight in decisions about raising second round capital?

Another business issue that investors might raise to Squire came from the discussion of different barbershop business models on case pp. 4-6. Squire did not work well for barbers who used the common rent-a-chair business model (case p. 6). In addition, to ensure the greatest customer satisfaction and engagement with Squire, the company required barbershops to stop using other booking or payments systems they had in place. This allowed Squire to deeply embed its product in barbershops’ workflows but could be a barrier to adoption for some shops, especially shops that were not run by tech-savvy owners or did not serve a tech-savvy clientele. Salvant and LaRon also faced early struggles to find tech talent and to build their product. The two founders were first-timers with zero entrepreneurial experience, lacked tech experience and expertise, and their early attempts to hire developers all failed. One developer was a known conman who tried to steal their money (case p. 3). Although they probably did not reveal that mistake to investors, many investors prefer at least one member of a founding team to have product development experience. Students may also raise the challenging unit economics, on the surface. Those unit economics may come up at this point in the discussion (see below) or later when the instructor asks for a more detailed assessment of the quality of the business model (below).\\n\\nSource: \"ENTRE_M2_BV3_05_17_2023 Jeff W1 Changes.docx - 39/136\"\\nwere very early in their startup journey and came with a $20,000 grant. Once they finished this three to four-month program, the co-founders were accepted into the YC Core program along with roughly 100 other startups. To compete in the program, the pair moved from New York City to San Francisco, California, for the summer. They took this opportunity to reach out to barbers in the area, sign them up to use the Squire app, and gather more information on usage. At the end of the summer, all founders enrolled in the YC Core program had the opportunity to pitch their startups to investors at an event called “demo day.” The purpose of the pitch event was to generate interest in their startup from investors and secure capital. Dave and Songe brought in a barber chair for the event and gave free haircuts to potential investors while pitching the Squire business model. They pitched between 75 and 100 investors but struggled to generate any interest or funding compared to other founders in their YC cohort.

Pedagogical Overview The case presents students with two distinct but related challenges: evaluating Squire’s business model and assessing to what extent race may have played a role in the founders’ early struggles to raise capital. It is clear from the case facts that investors’ views about Squire’s potential have improved dramatically over the first six years. Squire has made progress in running the vertical SaaS playbook, but still has untapped avenues. To what extent was early investor pessimism due to legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model, and to what extent was it due to racial bias?  Squire’s Business Model Students can begin their investigation by assessing the merits and weaknesses of Squire’s business model from a variety of angles. The case allows for an especially rich discussion of three components of Squire’s business model: market sizing, unit economics, and the evolution of unit economics illuminated via cohort analysis. Beyond the present context of assessing the strength of Squire’s business model, these are necessary tools for any founder, and applying them to Squire will serve as a valuable introduction or refresher.

This pattern of penetrating a vertical market with a simple SaaS product and then adding additional follow-on products, including financial services, to expand ARPU, LTV, and TAM is essentially the vertical SaaS playbook. Squire has the opportunity to execute this playbook with barbershops, and this case is an opportunity to learn that playbook for this particular vertical industry. See the Andreesen Horowitz blog post in the Recommended Additional Readings section for more on this topic. Racial Bias in Venture Capital and Venture-Backed Entrepreneurship A central theme throughout the case is the founders’ struggle to raise VC in their early days. The questions students are left with are: To what extent is this accounted for by legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model and prospects, and to what extent is this the result of implicit or explicit bias against Black founders? As the above analysis indicates, there was room to doubt Squire’s success in the early days. However, there is always room to doubt the success of early-stage ventures—indeed Jesse Middleton, WeWork cofounder and Squire’s first angel investor, says in the case (p. 4), “[W]hen you’re investing in early-stage prototypes, you look for one or two reasons to invest, not the hundreds of reasons not to.” And as for Salvant’s assessment of the causes of Squire’s early\\n\\nSource: \"LTV 2022 Slack.docx - 99/214\"\\nfew investors would have known that was possible (founders included). And in this case, did Squire get lucky? Which early-stage investor would have betted that these founders would have been able to get such loyal customers and get so much revenue in a fairly unproven business model?The fact that early-stage investing is not clear cut with few indicators is probably why so many VC funds look to others for validation and signaling and explains why within 7mo a company can get a 5x step-up in valuation. I struggled with the fact that one person / fund can change the trajectory of the business and if they had not received any initial funding – where would the business be today? How much of a startup’s success is based on the founder pedigree and ability to fundraise vs. the actual business? I wonder if there is a way to neutralize biases (especially when it is done at a widescale level) – perhaps through more standardized data and sharing around valuations and metrics? How has the industry worked to rectify systematic biases since this case was written? Also, I would love to talk more about how VC funds think about sharing allocation and looking to other funds for signals – has this led to successful outcomes? In some ways this seems like a boy’s club where people who are friends just give deals to each other and share their research, and another way to perpetuate biases…\\xa0(edited)\\xa0 Jeffrey Bussgang\\xa0\\xa05:42 PM On the question from\\xa0@Amna Ali\\xa0regarding right and wrong with respect\\n\\nSource: \"Squire Teaching Note.docx - 16/34\"\\nSalvant, case p.4 Lack of tech experience/expertise on the founding team; early struggles building their product                            Disrespected in meetings with investors Barbershops are often a low-tech business and thus slow to adopt technology into their business processes                 Strong credentials – JPMorgan, Yale Law, Y Combinator – White entrepreneurs with those credentials would not struggle to raise seed money Not every barbershop business model works equally well with Squire—thus, the small TAM would be further diminished        Jumping through hoops to raise money – YC fellowship before they could do the “real YC,” moving to Buffalo to get $650K Talk about, but no evidence of, adding follow-on products and services such as fintech elements (e.g., payments, credit)  Rich investors may not see the pain points that normal people face getting a haircut                                                                                                                           Investors see this as a business for Black barbershops, further reducing the TAM in their minds Source:\\tCasewriter.

Another business issue that investors might raise to Squire came from the discussion of different barbershop business models on case pp. 4-6. Squire did not work well for barbers who used the common rent-a-chair business model (case p. 6). In addition, to ensure the greatest customer satisfaction and engagement with Squire, the company required barbershops to stop using other booking or payments systems they had in place. This allowed Squire to deeply embed its product in barbershops’ workflows but could be a barrier to adoption for some shops, especially shops that were not run by tech-savvy owners or did not serve a tech-savvy clientele. Salvant and LaRon also faced early struggles to find tech talent and to build their product. The two founders were first-timers with zero entrepreneurial experience, lacked tech experience and expertise, and their early attempts to hire developers all failed. One developer was a known conman who tried to steal their money (case p. 3). Although they probably did not reveal that mistake to investors, many investors prefer at least one member of a founding team to have product development experience. Students may also raise the challenging unit economics, on the surface. Those unit economics may come up at this point in the discussion (see below) or later when the instructor asks for a more detailed assessment of the quality of the business model (below).\\n\\nSource: \"ENTRE_M2_BV3_05_17_2023 Jeff W1 Changes.docx - 39/136\"\\nwere very early in their startup journey and came with a $20,000 grant. Once they finished this three to four-month program, the co-founders were accepted into the YC Core program along with roughly 100 other startups. To compete in the program, the pair moved from New York City to San Francisco, California, for the summer. They took this opportunity to reach out to barbers in the area, sign them up to use the Squire app, and gather more information on usage. At the end of the summer, all founders enrolled in the YC Core program had the opportunity to pitch their startups to investors at an event called “demo day.” The purpose of the pitch event was to generate interest in their startup from investors and secure capital. Dave and Songe brought in a barber chair for the event and gave free haircuts to potential investors while pitching the Squire business model. They pitched between 75 and 100 investors but struggled to generate any interest or funding compared to other founders in their YC cohort.  For the following video, take note of what gave investors pause about the Squire business and why.   Songe LaRon and Dave Salvant, Squire [00:24:48.15] SONGE LARON: Yeah, so at first, market size was always an issue that frankly, we struggled with because this industry is very underserved, and it\\'s very fragmented, and it\\'s governed by state law, which means there\\'s 50 different laws that apply to barbershops.

Pedagogical Overview The case presents students with two distinct but related challenges: evaluating Squire’s business model and assessing to what extent race may have played a role in the founders’ early struggles to raise capital. It is clear from the case facts that investors’ views about Squire’s potential have improved dramatically over the first six years. Squire has made progress in running the vertical SaaS playbook, but still has untapped avenues. To what extent was early investor pessimism due to legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model, and to what extent was it due to racial bias?  Squire’s Business Model Students can begin their investigation by assessing the merits and weaknesses of Squire’s business model from a variety of angles. The case allows for an especially rich discussion of three components of Squire’s business model: market sizing, unit economics, and the evolution of unit economics illuminated via cohort analysis. Beyond the present context of assessing the strength of Squire’s business model, these are necessary tools for any founder, and applying them to Squire will serve as a valuable introduction or refresher.

       " {'answer': \"The KhataBook case revolves around several key issues. The first is the company's approach to monetization. As of January 2020, KhataBook, a digital ledger app for small businesses in India, had not generated any revenues or determined its ultimate business model, despite having raised $26.7 million through seed funding and a Series A round. The company had focused on customer acquisition and retention, as well as running a series of monetization experiments. Potential monetization opportunities considered by the company included lending as a service, a freemium model, and advertising. \\n\\nThe second issue is the timing of KhataBook's monetization efforts. The case compares KhataBook's situation to other startups, some of which faced less pressure from investors to monetize. For instance, Codecademy, an online platform offering coding classes, had the support of its investors in strategically delaying monetization experiments.\\n\\nThe third issue is the ethical choices made by KhataBook's co-founder and CEO, Ravish Naresh. The case discusses Naresh's aggressive competition strategies, such as copying a peer's concept, using images without permission in marketing campaigns, and attempting to steal away a competitor's funding.\\n\\nLastly, the case also touches on the challenges of operating at the bottom of the pyramid. KhataBook's target customers were small retail shops known as kirana shops, a segment that had seen an increase in digitalization of merchant and financial services due to the explosive growth of internet use in India. However, the question remained whether these customers valued the service enough to have a strong willingness to pay, thus affecting the company's total addressable market.\",\n",

Intent on raising a Series B funding round, Naresh considered monetization opportunities, including lending as a service, a freemium model, advertising, and others, while also increasing app downloads and post-install usage. But as a small team of only 40 employees, Naresh would need to choose his priorities carefully. Case Positioning This case is used in Launching Technology Ventures (LTV), an elective curriculum course for second-year MBA students at Harvard Business School. LTV was designed for students who plan to start their own companies, join early-stage startups, work at growth-stage technology firms, or invest in startups. This case is part of LTV’s third module, focused on business model experiments. As the module’s final case, it serves as a bridge case to connect to the course’s fourth module focused on financing, exits, and ethics. The case is appropriate for MBA and executive education audiences, as well as undergraduate courses on entrepreneurship or startup business models. Teaching Objectives The KhataBook case is intended to show students:  The importance of product-led growth as a technique to drive customer adoption and some of the design principles inherent in that strategy, including virality and a user experience that drives repeated usage. The criticality of the quality of growth, not just quantity. Adding users that disengage shortly after product trial\\n\\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 4/20\"\\nstrategy, including virality and a user experience that drives repeated usage. The criticality of the quality of growth, not just quantity. Adding users that disengage shortly after product trial leads to a “leaky bucket” phenomenon. This case pushes students to look beyond headling-grabbing, “vanity metrics” and understand the underlying usage metrics that drive loyalty and value. Reinforce the concept that startups are experimentation machines and a founder’s choice of experiments is a strategic one. Startup experiments occur within an envelope of time and money and, thus, the sequencing of the experiments—in this case growth then usage then monetization—is critical. As it is set in India, this case also provides students with a vehicle to explore the different rules and playbooks that founders face in developing countries. For example, using capital as a competitive weapon and securing funding from one of the few large capital providers is even more critical than in a developed country where capital and prospective investors are more abundant.

Operating in a fast-moving, competitive market, KhataBook could focus on customer acquisition, customer retention, or running a series of monetization experiments. Since its launch in 2018, KhataBook had raised $26.7 million through seed funding and a Series A round. By executing on product-led growth techniques, the startup had grown rapidly as measured by downloads and transactions. Yet, it had not generated any revenues or even determined its ultimate business model.

However, I was surprised by a few milestones Khatabook has achieved post the case - supported 10M merchants through the pandemic, currently operating at 600K monthly app installs all through the WOM (seriously!!), Ravish’s fundraising ability (raised >175M$ now) for Khatabook. Overall, it looks like a VC money fueled product growth, but the sustainability story is yet to be told. There are still huge risks for the business.

Intent on raising a Series B funding round, Naresh considered monetization opportunities, including lending as a service, a freemium model, advertising, and others, while also increasing app downloads and post-install usage. But as a small team of only 40 employees, Naresh would need to choose his priorities carefully. Case Positioning This case is used in Launching Technology Ventures (LTV), an elective curriculum course for second-year MBA students at Harvard Business School. LTV was designed for students who plan to start their own companies, join early-stage startups, work at growth-stage technology firms, or invest in startups. This case is part of LTV’s third module, focused on business model experiments. As the module’s final case, it serves as a bridge case to connect to the course’s fourth module focused on financing, exits, and ethics. The case is appropriate for MBA and executive education audiences, as well as undergraduate courses on entrepreneurship or startup business models. Teaching Objectives The KhataBook case is intended to show students:  The importance of product-led growth as a technique to drive customer adoption and some of the design principles inherent in that strategy, including virality and a user experience that drives repeated usage.

I came to the class thinking that Khatabook has a bleak chance to survive, because of a) low WTP for anything amongst shopkeepers (my Dad is a Kirana shop owner in India!), b) huge competition in lending services as\\xa0@Raghav Gupta\\xa0 mentioned and c) lack of high quality data to underwrite risk. However, I was surprised by a few milestones Khatabook has achieved post the case - supported 10M merchants through the pandemic, currently operating at 600K monthly app installs all through the WOM (seriously!!), Ravish’s fundraising ability (raised >175M$ now) for Khatabook. Overall, it looks like a VC money fueled product growth, but the sustainability story is yet to be told. There are still huge risks for the business. Ravish mentioned, during the coffee chat that he’s calibrating his mindset to build a business (he’s built products last 15 years but not business). Khatabook is still building human capital in the org to build.',\n",

Intent on raising a Series B funding round, Naresh considered monetization opportunities, including lending as a service, a freemium model, advertising, and others, while also increasing app downloads and post-install usage. But as a small team of only 40 employees, Naresh would need to choose his priorities carefully. Case Positioning This case is used in Launching Technology Ventures (LTV), an elective curriculum course for second-year MBA students at Harvard Business School. LTV was designed for students who plan to start their own companies, join early-stage startups, work at growth-stage technology firms, or invest in startups. This case is part of LTV’s third module, focused on business model experiments. After the successful execution of the previous business plans, the team was brimming with optimism for their future plans. The feedback they had received from their clients had strengthened their belief in the product they were building. Furthermore, the exponential growth in their user base was a testament to the potential the product had in the market. They had successfully identified a gap in the market and their product was meeting the demands of that gap effectively. The journey had been challenging, but the results were gratifying. The company was not just financially successful but also influential in shaping industry trends. The digital revolution has ushered in an era of unprecedented access to information and has drastically reduced the costs of communication. This has had a profound impact on all aspects of our lives, from how we work to how we socialize and learn. In the world of business, the digital revolution has levelled the playing field, allowing small startups to compete with large established firms. One of the key factors in this transformation has been the advent of digital marketing, which has given businesses of all sizes the ability to reach a global audience at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing methods. The growth of social media has further amplified this impact, providing a platform for businesses to engage with their customers in a more personal and direct manner.\\n\\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 12/20\"\\nuse the app to take and receive orders with other users. They, in turn, may then begin using KhataBook’s bookkeeping features. Likewise, the overall retention rate could increase, as new users that downloaded the app for the bookkeeping function could stick with the app if it added e-commerce features. Pasture Two: Bottom of the Pyramid (20 minutes) Transition to the second pasture with an assessment of KhataBook’s existing market. Ask: Why is KhataBook a real opportunity in 2019 versus five years ago? Students should refer to Case pp. 2-3, noting that digital adoption lagged among KhataBook’s target customers, kirana shop owners, and other small business owners. However, the explosive growth of internet use in India due to declining smartphone prices and increased online penetration driven by Reliance Jio had seen an increase in digitalization of merchant and financial services.  Follow up, asking students a more provocative question, Can you build a big business at the bottom of the pyramid? Or are KhataBook’s target customers willing to use a free app but do not value the service enough to have a strong willingness to pay (WTP), lifetime value (LTV), and thus total addressable market (TAM)? Record responses on the board, as displayed on Board Three in Board Plan, p. 10. Responses may include: Yes. Per p. 3 of the case, focusing on B2B small merchant services was a popular and valuable space for investment in India. Many kirana merchants record their transactions manually\\n\\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 6/20\"\\nTwo: Bottom of the Pyramid 20 minutes\\tPasture Three: Ethical Choices 10 minutes\\tWrap Up Discussion Plan Pasture One: Monetization Experiments (30 minutes) The instructor should open the case by reviewing Naresh’s situation in January 2020 as KhataBook races to become India’s preeminent digital ledger app. KhataBook secured Series A funding in September 2019 and had focused on usage, or “bottom of the funnel” growth (case p. 7). Consider referencing Tavel’s Hierarchy of Engagement, as displayed on Board One in Board Plan, p. 10, from Sarah Tavel’s framework to evaluate non-transactional consumer companies and the importance of getting users to perform the core action—that is, the essence or foundation of the product and its value proposition. In the case of KhataBook, the core action is for a merchant to use the app to record a transaction with another merchant, which, if done correctly, can kick off a viral loop as the receiving merchant must get the app to receive the information electronically. Next, the class can discuss monetization experiments that founders run to test different aspects of their business model and the timing of those experiments. To contrast the forthcoming discussion of KhataBook, review examples of startups that faced less pressure from investors to monetize. For example, investors of Codecademy, an online platform offering coding classes, were supportive of Codecademy strategically delaying monetization experiments. KhataBook, on the other hand,\\n\\nSource: \"LTV 2022 - All Case Takeaways.pdf - Page 86\"\\nThere were many things that happened there and many things that definitely didn\\'t happen.

Assignment Questions How would you characterize KhataBook’s approach to monetization? Compare KhataBook’s monetization timing situation to other startups.  What monetization experiments should Naresh run? Are you comfortable with Naresh’s choices and actions to date? Would you have made similar ones?

Team: Assess the founding team's ability to articulate a compelling vision, their integrity, and whether they inspire you and others around them. \\n\\n2. Market: Evaluate if the market the company is operating in is massive (i.e., greater than $1 billion in revenue potential), experiencing disruption that might lead to opportunity for a new entrant like this startup, and how crowded the market is. \\n\\n3.

Stage of the Startup: Understand the operational maturity, cash position, and path to growth for the company. The stage of a startup will reflect the skills needed for hires as well. \\n\\n5.

Risk: Be aware that early-stage startups are more likely to fail or go sideways, and you may be looking for another job in a year or two. \\n\\n7. Experimentation: Consider if the startup is willing to experiment and test their business model components, especially the most controversial ones. \\n\\n8. Long-term Value Creation: Early-stage startups are typically technology-driven with deep Intellectual Property (IP). If the technology works, value is created.

I’ve sometimes been right about the market value but too early. And I’ve been spot on with both but backed the 2nd, 3rd or 4th best player in a market. In short: Access to great deals, ability to be invited to invest in these deals, ability to see where value in a market will be created and the luck to back the right team with the right market at the right time all matter. When you first start your career as an investor (or when you first start writing angel checks) your main obsession is “getting into great deals.” You’re thinking about one bullet at a time. When you’ve been playing the game a bit longer or when you have responsibilities at the fund level you start thinking more about “portfolio construction.” At Upfront we often talk about these as “shots on goal” (a fitting soccer analogy given the EURO 2020 tournament is on right now). What we discuss internally and what I discuss with my LPs is outlined as follows: We tell our LPs the truth, which is that when we write the first check we think each one is going to be an amazing company but 10–15 years later it has been much hard to have predicted which would be the major fund drivers.

I’ve sometimes been right about the market value but too early. And I’ve been spot on with both but backed the 2nd, 3rd or 4th best player in a market. In short: Access to great deals, ability to be invited to invest in these deals, ability to see where value in a market will be created and the luck to back the right team with the right market at the right time all matter. When you first start your career as an investor (or when you first start writing angel checks) your main obsession is “getting into great deals.” You’re thinking about one bullet at a time. When you’ve been playing the game a bit longer or when you have responsibilities at the fund level you start thinking more about “portfolio construction.” At Upfront we often talk about these as “shots on goal” (a fitting soccer analogy given the EURO 2020 tournament is on right now). What we discuss internally and what I discuss with my LPs is outlined as follows: We tell our LPs the truth, which is that when we write the first check we think each one is going to be an amazing company but 10–15 years later it has been much hard to have predicted which would be the major fund drivers.

An earlier-stage company, particularly one that is not necessarily perceived as “hot” and has a huge amount of momentum, will be more willing to take a risk on you and give you more responsibility than a more mature growth stage com - pany.

Do your  own due diligence, and don’t be afraid to be cynical about the spin  you hear about a particular startup in the media versus the reality  inside the four walls. How does an outsider conduct due diligence like an insider? Use the rubric that all investors use. Evaluate each company along the same criteria we venture capitalists employ,  which are typically three simple ones.With the prospect of raising capital, the founders were uncertain about its allocation. Mirroring dilemmas faced by many bootstrapped founders, they considered whether to cash in some or most of the money by selling their shares. Alternatively, should they reinvest in product development and customer success, following a Product Led Growth strategy to enhance company value more rapidly? Or should they prioritize building a robust sales and marketing team, akin to companies like Atlassian, Dropbox, Slack, and Zoom in their scaling phase? Moreover, they contemplated how their hiring strategy should change, as they planned to substantially expand the team size.\\n\\nSource: \"Entering Startup Land.pdf - Page 213\"\\nmultiple roles, grow more rapidly, and have more senior exposure.  The downside is that you are less likely to have great mentors from whom you can learn as compared to a larger startup. Further, it is more likely that this early-stage startup will fail or go sideways and you will be looking for another job in a year or two. If you are  willing to take more risk and operate with greater uncertainty, the  quality of the experience at the early-stage startup can be superior to that of being a small cog in the larger, hot startup. This series of steps—picking your domain, your city, the stage  you’re most interested in, and companies within that city that fit  that stage in that sector—generally results in a very small list.  Thus, at that point, you can decide which companies to focus on. If you’re in a larger startup community—like San Francisco, New York, or Boston—you tend to have a lot of companies that are in  the particular stage and sector.

Having a mix of blinker and thinker traits (as defined by Malcolm Gladwell) will help as well. The stage of a start-up will reflect the skills needed for hires as well.

Their vision of creating a tool that empowered individuals, regardless of their technical prowess, to design software products was taking form. The concept of low-code and no-code software development, although a niche market in 2012, was gaining traction by 2018. However, Haas and Straschnov felt a sense of accomplishment in their cautious approach so far. As melodies played in the background, they pondered over the pivotal question - should they accept external funding? With a small team and a myriad of needs spanning engineering to marketing, they contemplated how such funding could be utilized to accelerate growth. With the prospect of raising capital, the founders were uncertain about its allocation. Mirroring dilemmas faced by many bootstrapped founders, they considered whether to cash in some or most of the money by selling their shares.

You should only  attempt to develop personas after you have a deep understanding of  prospective customers and their needs.

You should only  attempt to develop personas after you have a deep understanding of  prospective customers and their needs.

In terms of product strategy, Shippo should amplify the value proposition of the API so that they are competing in areas beyond price, for example, by adding additional services like package tracking or insurance.  To spearhead this transformation to a developer-oriented strategy, Shippo might consider hiring an experienced computer scientist for an executive role such as chief of API or even chief technology officer. In that scenario, Kreuz might move into another role such as chief of product.  Wrap Up The instructor may want to wrap up the case discussion with the following closing insights: Founder-market fit can be subtle. While Behrens Wu may have lacked provable technical skills, she had the grit, courage, strategic skills, charisma, and persistence that start-up founders need to be successful in a highly competitive funding environment. Some call this the X factor; others refer to “force of nature” entrepreneurs. Whatever you call it, great founders don’t just have relevant experience and history but can also simply have huge amounts of hustle and other skills to achieve founder-market fit. Rapid customer growth can appear to indicate product-market fit, but may actually represent a false positive. In the case of Shippo, the team offered a strong value proposition and had a good delivery platform (channel), but as churn data shows, the initial product\\n\\nSource: \"Shippo Teaching Plan.docx - 5/24\"\\nBehrens Wu has an authentic interest in and stake in the shipping industry because it allows people who live in different places to access the same products (case p. 4). “X Factor.” If they do not have founder-market fit on paper, Shippo’s leaders have something special, often referred to as an “X factor” by investors. The founding team has displayed persistence, grit, and savvy to seek and act on the advice of technology insiders. The team at Plug and Play recognized these qualities when they saw an “enprepreneurial sparkle” in the founders’ eyes (case p. 7). When she had no contacts in the technology start-up world, Behrens Wu networked her way from Germany to an internship in San Francisco (case p. 3). By building Shippo’s two software products, Kreuz has demonstrated that he can learn the requisite skills to be a developer (case p. 4). While Y Combinator is a powerful voice with a strong track record in Silicon Valley, not all VCs are as biased toward technical founders. In addition, Shippo has some business experience: Kreuz has an MBA and Behrens Wu studied in a graduate business program (case pp. 3-4).  Some students may question the concept of founder-market fit, arguing that founders can evolve alongside their companies and should not be limited to industries with which they are familiar.

Ask, “Do these entrepreneurs have to work harder to make up for a lack of\\n\\nSource: \"Shippo Teaching Plan.docx - 4/24\"\\ndefinition. Responses can be recorded on Board 1. No. Shippo lacks founder-market fit because neither Behrens Wu nor Kreuz has formal training in software development. They have already struggled to create efficient software development processes, as exemplified by Figure 2 (case p. 7). They also lack general business experience. Behrens Wu’s internship experience in customer acquisition perhaps prepared her modestly for a business-to-consumer (B2C) environment, not a B2B firm that sells to developers.  The founders’ brief experience as an e-commerce retailer (and Shopify client) makes them sympathetic to the needs of small business owners but does not prepare them to recruit developers. This non-technical team will struggle to attract developers through inbound marketing. The team’s Y Combinator rejection suggests that technology investors are often biased towards entrepreneurs who have a technical background themselves, particularly when the product and customer are technical in nature, as is the case with Shippo.  Yes. Behrens Wu has demonstrated a commitment to enterprise users.

Following the $2 million seed round, Shippo went on to raise $7 million in series A round led by Union Square Ventures (USV). Following the round, USV’s Albert Wenger joined the Shippo board of directors. By September 2016, 10,000 companies together shipped millions of packages using Shippo’s software each month. In addition, Shippo hired engineer Sin-Mei Tsai to serve as vice president of engineering and e-commerce marketer Mikhail Ledvich as head of marketing. In September 2016, Shippo had 28 employees, and offered both a dashboard app and an API, but had decided to focus more tightly on the API strategy as its main growth engine. In a 2016 blogpost, Behrens Wu reflected on the future of her company: “Raising this round is really about growing the company.

Responses can be recorded on Board 1. No. Shippo lacks founder-market fit because neither Behrens Wu nor Kreuz has formal training in software development. They have already struggled to\\nSource: \"Shippo Teaching Plan.docx - 5/24\"\\nBehrens Wu has an authentic interest in and stake in the shipping industry because it allows people who live in different places to access the same products (case p. 4). “X Factor.” If they do not have founder-market fit on paper, Shippo’s leaders have something special, often referred to as an “X factor” by investors. The founding team has displayed persistence, grit, and savvy to seek and act on the advice of technology insiders. The team at Plug and Play recognized these qualities when they saw an “enprepreneurial sparkle” in the founders’ eyes (case p. 7). When she had no contacts in the technology start-up world, Behrens Wu networked her way from Germany to an internship in San Francisco (case p. 3). By building Shippo’s two software products, Kreuz has demonstrated that he can learn the requisite skills to be a developer (case p. 4). While Y Combinator is a powerful voice with a strong track record in Silicon Valley, not all VCs are as biased toward technical founders. In addition, Shippo has some business experience: Kreuz has an MBA and Behrens Wu studied in a graduate business program (case pp. 3-4).  Some students may question the concept of founder-market fit, arguing that founders can evolve alongside their companies and should not be limited to industries with which they are familiar. Press students to consider the consequences of failing to achieve founder-market fit from the beginning. Ask, “Do these entrepreneurs have to work harder to make up for a lack of\\nSource: \"Shippo Teaching Plan.docx - 19/24\"\\nsuch as Quora and Stack Exchange, and can design marketing materials to make them developer-friendly (case p. 9).  In terms of product strategy, Shippo should amplify the value proposition of the API so that they are competing in areas beyond price, for example, by adding additional services like package tracking or insurance.  To spearhead this transformation to a developer-oriented strategy, Shippo might consider hiring an experienced computer scientist for an executive role such as chief of API or even chief technology officer. In that scenario, Kreuz might move into another role such as chief of product.  Wrap Up The instructor may want to wrap up the case discussion with the following closing insights: Founder-market fit can be subtle. While Behrens Wu may have lacked provable technical skills, she had the grit, courage, strategic skills, charisma, and persistence that start-up founders need to be successful in a highly competitive funding environment. Some call this the X factor; others refer to “force of nature” entrepreneurs. Whatever you call it, great founders don’t just have relevant experience and history but can also simply have huge amounts of hustle and other skills to achieve founder-market fit. Rapid customer growth can appear to indicate product-market fit, but may actually represent a false positive. In the case of Shippo, the team offered a strong value proposition and had a good delivery platform (channel), but as churn data shows, the initial product\\nSource: \"Shippo Teaching Plan.docx - 21/24\"\\nan MVP to test and establish product-market fit, entrepreneurs postpone the costs and time associated with fixing the product’s bugs.

Responses can be recorded on Board 1. No. Shippo lacks founder-market fit because neither Behrens Wu nor Kreuz has formal training in software development. They have already struggled to create efficient software development processes, as exemplified by Figure 2 (case p. 7). They also lack general business experience. Behrens Wu’s internship experience in customer acquisition perhaps prepared her modestly for a business-to-consumer (B2C) environment, not a B2B firm that sells to developers.  The founders’ brief experience as an e-commerce retailer (and Shopify client) makes them sympathetic to the needs of small business owners but does not prepare them to recruit developers.

       " {'answer': \"Equity dilution over time can vary greatly depending on the number of funding rounds and the amount of capital raised in each round. However, there are some general rules of thumb. For instance, in each round of financing, it's typical to avoid selling more than 20% of your company, which means you could expect around 20% dilution per round. However, this can sometimes be pushed to 25% or even 30% in some cases. It's also important to note that the dilution is a function of the amount of capital you raise and your post-money valuation. For example, if you were to raise $5M on a $50M post-money valuation, you would be selling 10% of the company and thus diluting yourself by 10%. Over the course of a startup's life, especially if it goes through multiple rounds of financing from pre-seed through Series A, B, C, and beyond, the cumulative dilution can be significant.\",\n",
       "  'context': 'Source: \"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/understanding-how-dilution-affects-you-at-a-startup-4fb4cd29ad5c\"\\nThis post originally appeared on TechCrunch. Dilution. Or as industry insiders call it, “taking a haircut.” Everybody knows that when you raise money at a startup your ownership percentage of the company goes down. The goal is to have the value of the startup go up by enough that you own a smaller percentage of a much larger business and therefore your total personal value goes up. The simplest way to think about this is: If you own 20% of a $2 million company your stake is worth $400,000. If you raise a new round venture capital (say $2.5 million at a $7.5 million pre-money valuation, which is a $10 million post-money) you get diluted by 25% (2.5m / 10m). So you own 15% of the new company but that 15% is now worth $1.5 million or a gain of $1.1 million. But understanding how you’re likely to get diluted over time is a more difficult concept. And figuring out how much your equity may be worth over the course of a 5-year stint at a startup is even more complicated. I’ve had to simplify a bit, but to make it easier to understand I’ve teamed up with Jess Bachman at Visual.ly. If you want to see a view of the power of their work check out this Steve Jobs infographic. I’m a huge believer in Info Graphics and the ability to create deeper understanding of complicated topics through visual means. As “Big Data” becomes more pervasive the power to visualize will become increasingly important. And Jess is awesome at his trade.

That rule isn’t precise—perhaps you might push it to 25% or even 30% in some cases if you are really keen on the money and the financial partner, but generally this “rule of 20” holds. This matrix is a planning tool to help founders think through not only the amount of money you want (the x axis) but the implications on the dilution based on the valuation (the y axis) and the threshold beyond which you want to avoid. Thus, if the Chief founders really want to raise $20 million and execute on their more aggressive expansion plans, they need to convince investors that they are worth $100 million in post-money valuation in order to avoid violating the rule of 20% and suffering too much dilution at the series A—a tall order!

In my experience, because founders are subject to four year vesting like everyone else, there are thoughtful conversations about founder incentives 5+ years into a startup\\'s life. We tend to arrange for annual stock option grants for both the founders and top team members so that their \"hold\" (i.e., the value of their unvested shares) continues to be a significant incentive. We also tend to encourage founders to take money off the table. My target is usually $2-4M after tax as it\\'s enough to pay down the mortgage/buy a nice home, have money for kids\\' college, and be able to focus on going long. I recently bought $4M from one of my founder/CEOs who started the company when he was in college and had zero liquidity over 8 years of company-building despite his 20% stake now being worth $100m on paper. Another rule of thumb is to sell 5-10% of their total holdings. In general, founders get well taken care of if they\\'re performing well.

Now there are two events: the initial issuance of founders common shares, and then issuing new founders common shares along with creating an options pool. In this manner, you can see both the current equity distribution of the company, as well as historically what the equity holdings looked like. If the full pool were to be given out, the dilution is fairly significant to the founders. They would own from 55% and 45% down to 36% and 29%, but until options are exercised they are not diluted. Jane and Dick contemplated a small option pool because they had read about the risk of an option pool shuffle, but ultimately decided to make it 20% based on feedback from their friend Josh, a Boston-based venture capitalist. Our (now three) co-founders begin building out their product. The co-founders have savings to live off of and cash will be conserved by not having any salaries.

When the Chief founders mapped out their two plans and the operating expenses required to achieve their two valuation inflection points, they came to the conclusion that they should raise $5 million on the low end—for the more conservative plan—and $20 million on the high end for the more aggressive plan. Entering in a number of assumptions regarding the company’s post-money valuation allows you to draw out this dilution matrix: Post $ Valuation    Raise $5M    Raise $10M    Raise $15M    Raise $20M $40M                13%          25%           38%           50% $60M                8%           17%           25%           33% $80M                6%           13%           19%           25% $100M               5%           10%           15%           20% Most founders are dilution sensitive—rightfully so! They want to own as much of their company as possible. But remember my earlier reference to Rich vs. King? To build a wildly successful startup that scales, founders need to share their equity with investors and team members. How much equity is shared is the tricky question. Because founders know that there will be multiple rounds of financing from start to finish—from pre-seed through Series A, B, C, and beyond—there is a typical rule of thumb that you should avoid selling more than 20% of your company in any single round of financing. That rule isn’t\\n\\nSource: \"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/the-truth-about-convertible-debt-at-startups-and-the-hidden-terms-you-didn-t-understand-9fccf6854dee\"\\n[update: Adeo thought that I hadn’t quite explained easily enough why this creates a 3x liquidation preference so I agreed to expand. Only read this red bit if you didn’t quite follow the argument above. If somebody gives you money under a convertible debt note at a $2.5m valuation and another person funds you with convertible debt at $5m valuation (high resolution financing) and your equity round finally closes at a $10 million valuation … what technically happens? The most straightforward way to do the deal and what most people do is to issue the first investor 4 times more shares than the ultimate equity investor to adjust for the 4x discount in price (ie if I give you 4x the shares it’s the same as though you paid 25% of the price for the shares). The second investor gets 2x more shares (50% discount). So in the end they all end up with Series A stock priced at the exact same price (say, $1.5 per share) but investor 1 & 2 have more stock than investor 3. And if I weren’t simplifying the math, I’d show you that the first investors get even more shares since they have a discount to the next round. So as your initial investor at a $2.5m they now have 4x the stock and thus 4x the liquidation preferences (since each share has liquidation preferences on it).\\n\\nSource: \"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-much-should-you-raise-in-your-vc-round-and-what-is-a-vc-looking-at-in-your-model-3b79ff436b63\"\\nEvery VC knows that the amount you raise is often a proxy for your valuation. VCs in early stage round assume that you will likely take 20–25% dilution for your funding round so if you’re raising $8–10 million they will assume your expectation is $24 million pre at the low-end of the range ($8m x 4 = $32m post money with $8m capital injected buying 25% of the company) and $40 million pre at the high end ($10m x 5= $50m post money with $10m capital injected buying 20% or $40m pre). So when you say $8–10m is your goal and you aren’t at all thinking about your valuation know that a VC hears “$24–40 million pre-money valuation expectations.” Of course there are times where 15% dilution is more appropriate and other times it can be 33% but in a first meeting we’re just trying to establish general ranges for reasonableness. If you’ve only ever raised $500k, have limited revenue, have 7 people at your company and aren’t a serial entrepreneur it’s a pretty tall order to imagine going straight to $8–10 million unless your data is very compelling or you’ve otherwise become “hot.” If you’ve raised $3 million previously, have $250k in monthly recurring revenue and 23 staff an $8–10 million round might be more down the fairway.\\n\\nSource: \"ENTRE_M3_BV3_05_17_2023 Jeff W1 Changes.docx - 69/120\"\\nquickly?

That rule isn’t precise—perhaps you might push it to 25% or even 30% in some cases if you are really keen on the money and the financial partner, but generally this “rule of 20” holds. This matrix is a planning tool to help founders think through not only the amount of money you want (the x axis) but the implications on the dilution based on the valuation (the y axis) and the threshold beyond which you want to avoid. Thus, if the Chief founders really want to raise $20 million and execute on their more aggressive expansion plans, they need to convince investors that they are worth $100 million in post-money valuation in order to avoid violating the rule of 20% and suffering too much dilution at the series A—a tall order! Let’s learn how Lindsay thought about dilution and selling off equity of the company. Lindsay Kaplan [00:37:27.48] LINDSAY KAPLAN: As a founder, every time you raise, you\\'re giving away a piece of your equity. And so, it\\'s not just the question of, do we raise? How much do we raise now, later? There is the existential question of, should I be diluting my own stock in this company? And it\\'s another reason to feel like you have to have traction, you have to believe that this money is going to 10x the business.

In my experience, because founders are subject to four year vesting like everyone else, there are thoughtful conversations about founder incentives 5+ years into a startup\\'s life. We tend to arrange for annual stock option grants for both the founders and top team members so that their \"hold\" (i.e., the value of their unvested shares) continues to be a significant incentive. We also tend to encourage founders to take money off the table. My target is usually $2-4M after tax as it\\'s enough to pay down the mortgage/buy a nice home, have money for kids\\' college, and be able to focus on going long. I recently bought $4M from one of my founder/CEOs who started the company when he was in college and had zero liquidity over 8 years of company-building despite his 20% stake now being worth $100m on paper. Another rule of thumb is to sell 5-10% of their total holdings. In general, founders get well taken care of if they\\'re performing well. If you don\\'t want accountability from investors or a board of directors that you have to answer to, you need to make the Rich vs. King trade off (aka\\xa0The Founder\\'s Dilemma).

Dilution. Or as industry insiders call it, “taking a haircut.” Everybody knows that when you raise money at a startup your ownership percentage of the company goes down. The goal is to have the value of the startup go up by enough that you own a smaller percentage of a much larger business and therefore your total personal value goes up. The simplest way to think about this is: If you own 20% of a $2 million company your stake is worth $400,000. If you raise a new round venture capital (say $2.5 million at a $7.5 million pre-money valuation, which is a $10 million post-money) you get diluted by 25% (2.5m / 10m). So you own 15% of the new company but that 15% is now worth $1.5 million or a gain of $1.1 million. But understanding how you’re likely to get diluted over time is a more difficult concept. And figuring out how much your equity may be worth over the course of a 5-year stint at a startup is even more complicated. I’ve had to simplify a bit, but to make it easier to understand I’ve teamed up with Jess Bachman at Visual.ly. If you want to see a view of the power of their work check out this Steve Jobs infographic. I’m a huge believer in Info Graphics and the ability to create deeper understanding of complicated topics through visual means. As “Big Data” becomes more pervasive the power to visualize will become increasingly important. And Jess is awesome at his trade.

Now there are two events: the initial issuance of founders common shares, and then issuing new founders common shares along with creating an options pool. In this manner, you can see both the current equity distribution of the company, as well as historically what the equity holdings looked like. If the full pool were to be given out, the dilution is fairly significant to the founders. They would own from 55% and 45% down to 36% and 29%, but until options are exercised they are not diluted. Jane and Dick contemplated a small option pool because they had read about the risk of an option pool shuffle, but ultimately decided to make it 20% based on feedback from their friend Josh, a Boston-based venture capitalist. Our (now three) co-founders begin building out their product. The co-founders have savings to live off of and cash will be conserved by not having any salaries.

When the Chief founders mapped out their two plans and the operating expenses required to achieve their two valuation inflection points, they came to the conclusion that they should raise $5 million on the low end—for the more conservative plan—and $20 million on the high end for the more aggressive plan. Entering in a number of assumptions regarding the company’s post-money valuation allows you to draw out this dilution matrix: Post $ Valuation    Raise $5M    Raise $10M    Raise $15M    Raise $20M $40M                13%          25%           38%           50% $60M                8%           17%           25%           33% $80M                6%           13%           19%           25% $100M               5%           10%           15%           20% Most founders are dilution sensitive—rightfully so!
