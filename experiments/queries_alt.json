    "answer": "The amount of equity given to an advisor in a startup can vary based on several factors, including the advisor's expected contribution, the value of their involvement, and the existing capital structure of the company. However, it is generally suggested that advisors, who typically contribute less value than directors, should receive a lower equity grant. A common suggestion is an annual grant of 25% to 50% of the four-year grant you'd give a junior engineer. This would equate to 1x - 2x a junior engineer's grant if the advisor stays engaged for four years. It's also recommended to vest the equity over time and ensure there's a tangible commitment associated with it.",

I’ll dedicate a longer post to how to make sure these are effective (as they rarely are) – in any event, advisors typically have a much lower commitment to the company and, as a result, should receive a much lower equity grant.  In addition, advisory boards tend to come and go so it’s better to compensate members on an annual basis.  A good proxy for the amount is an annual grant of 25% to 50% of the four year grant you’d give a junior engineer (so 1x – 2x a junior engineer if the advisor stays engaged for four years).  Obviously, there are exceptions to this, but if you want to get meaningful, sustainable involvement from an “advisor”, consider giving him a more significant role. Finally, VCs should never get additional equity for board service in private companies.  The VC has already purchased his equity and his board involvement is a function of his responsibilities associated with his investment.  I’ve been on the receiving end of this and it has always felt weird.  In a public company, it’s typical to compensate all board members – including the VCs – equivalently, but private companies are a different matter.\n\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2011/06/warning-to-all-entrepreneurs-about-bad-investor-behavior/\"\nI find this kind of behavior disgusting. If the person was offering to put in $25k – $100k in the round and then asking for an additional 1% or 2% as an “active advisor” (beyond whatever the investment bought) to help out with the company, I’d still be skeptical of the equity ask at this stage and encourage the founders to (a) vest it over time and (b) make sure there was a tangible commitment associated with it that was different from other investors. Instead, given the facts I was given, my feedback was to run far away, fast. Entrepreneurs – beware. This is the kind of behavior that gives investors a bad name. Unfortunately, my impression of this particular person is that he’s not a constructive early stage investor but rather someone who is trying to prey on naive entrepreneurs.

People do what people do. You have money, you spend it. And there are consequences for spending too much money. I was always fond of saying about fund raising, “When the hor d’oeuvres tray is passed take two and put one in your pocket for later. Just don’t take the whole tray.” My analogy was that there are markets where it’s relatively easier to raise capital and therefore you should take a little bit more but you should create a budget where you only spend 70% of what you raise on a pace of 18 months. But people never do. Justin is right. I know it sounds crazy but at the earliest stages of a company your valuation often is determined by how much money you raise. There is a general guideline of how much investors want to own in order to invest in your company and the norm is 15–30% with the most common range 20–25% per early stage round. So the temptation would be to ask for $5 million because that implies a $20 million pre-money valuation if you’re able to only give away 20% or a $15 million pre-money valuation of investors require 25%. A $15–20 million valuation sounds better than an $8 million valuation, doesn’t it? It seems almost silly to argue that it’s better to have an $8 million valuation. But it’s actually not that silly.\n\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2006/05/how-many-stock-options-should-i-give-an-advisor/\"\nUsually, you’ll be granting stock options (non-qualified stock options – “non-quals” or NQSO’s) to the advisor.  As a result you should think through vesting carefully.  Many advisors contribute much of their value early in the life of the relationship so rather than giving a grant that vests over four years, you might consider making an annual grant and then revisiting things in a year to see if the relationship is living up to expectations.  A savvy advisor will prefer to get a bigger grant that vests over four years since it will allow them to lock in a strike price at today’s fair market value (FMV) of the stock (which – in the success case – will likely be lower than the FMV in the future).  At the minimum, this will facilitate a conversation about revisiting things annually to make sure everyone’s expectation is being met with the relationship.\n\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2006/05/how-many-stock-options-should-i-give-an-advisor/\"\nI received the following question recently: Just want to ask you a question. I’m looking to bring in a couple of advisors for my startup, how much stock and the approximate % of equity should I give that’s fair to the advisors for their invaluable advice? I was thinking of 100,000 shares each that equates to 1% company equity. Can you advice me on what’s the norm? 1% is rich.  In the past, I’ve given some ground rules for equity grants for directors – 1% vesting over four years is at the top end of the range.  Advisors typically (although not always) contribute much less value to a company than directors and their equity grant should correspondingly be less.  Of course, the amount you give depends on a number of factors, including things like your expectation of what the advisor will provide, how much you value this involvement, and the existing capital structure of the company (e.g. larger grants if you are younger, smaller grants if you are a more mature company.)\n\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2011/07/finance-fridays-getting-started-allocating-equity-and-founders-investment/\"\nJane indicated that the most she could invest in the company before they would have to seek other sources of capital was $50k. Dick hated to think that he would be diluted by more than 20% of his stake over $50k and proposed that Jane receive 10% incremental equity for her $50k. Jane felt comfortable with receiving 10% for $50k, but no less, so they agreed on a $450k pre money valuation of their startup. There are a number of ways Jane and Dick could have executed the equity transaction. The simplest would be if they agreed in the founders documents that they would both commit full-time to the business, Jane would contribute an initial $50k, and they would split the equity 55/45 in favor of Jane. Dick and Jane have now successfully navigated their first finance challenge: dividing up the founders’ equity, including an investment from one of the founders. A few key lessons from today’s post are: Next week, we will address how Jane and Dick put proper accounting systems in place. Oh, and you’ll notice that they don’t yet have a name for their company. They’ve told us they are open to suggestions.\n\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2011/07/finance-fridays-getting-started-allocating-equity-and-founders-investment/\"\nJane and Dick had several options, including structuring this as a debt transaction where Jane simply loaned the money to the company, or as convertible debt transaction where Jane’s investment would convert into equity in the next round. But they worried that future investors would frown on that or wouldn’t give Jane credit for the investment at a later date, since they might consider it as part of Jane’s contribution to her original ownership position of 50%. That narrowed the possibilities down to an equity transaction, which would in turn require a conversation about valuation. Jane and Dick briefly considered a valuation based on the next external financing round, perhaps applying a discount. For example, if the first round of external investment values the company at $2 million post and, prior to that, Jane had invested $50,000, then with no discount, Jane’s investment would earn her 2.5% of the company ($50k/$2M = 2.5%). If they agreed on a 20% discount, then Jane would be entitled to 3.125% of the company ($2M * (1-20% discount) = $1.6M; $50k/$1.6M = 3.125%). At this stage it wasn’t clear when (or even if) the first round of external financing might occur or what it might look like, which made agreeing on a discount just as difficult as agreeing on a valuation, while adding complexity. After a tense conversation about this, Jane and Dick decided to go out for a beer and try to resolve the equity allocation issue once and for all.\n\nSource: \"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/raising-angel-money-cc9f8ab923b6\"\nAs an entrepreneur you should raise money from the most experienced people possible — period. If you have the opportunity to raise a small amount of money from a group of experienced investors who have a track record of helping companies get from that tricky idea stage to being a well-formed company with a good product and solid market-entry strategy I would take the money — even if it were priced. Worrying about giving up an extra 10% of your company at this stage can be meaningless if the ultimate outcome is either success or failure. Even VC’s think this way, which is why Fred Wilson when describing his decision to syndicate a portion of his invesment in GeoCities to another investor says, “I learned that good partners are worth every penny of returns you give up to get them.” (whole article here if you’re interested) Don’t worry about getting “screwed” by sage angel investors. If they really are well regarded and serial investors they won’t likely screw you. Why? Because if they try to take 50% of your company for $500,000 then they know it will be very hard to raise VC because we’ll know that too much of the value has been taken away from the founders before our investment. People like John Greathouse and Klaus Schauser in Santa Barbara have a great track record both in building companies themselves and also in helping the companies that they angel fund pull together great management teams, launch great technology products and importantly raise VC from top-notch VC’s.\n\nSource: \"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/some-career-advice-for-aspiring-tech-ceos-ba546f8c11e9\"\n4. Incoming into a VC fixer-upper you often have leverage over personal compensationIn Ian’s post he rightly points out that stepping into a role with $15 million in paid-in capital that has already been spent can be a problem. This is because this “liquidation preference” gets returned to investors before you see any money — restricting the executive outcomes in mid-sized exits. But when the VC is looking for somebody willing to take on a project with a bit of hair, you actually have more leverage than you think (precisely because many people won’t take on that assignment). So you may — for example — ask for a deal in your contract that guarantees you will get a minimum of $500,000 on any sale or you may agree that your stock is exited “pari passu” with the existing liquidation preferences or that management is guaranteed a minimum bonus of $2 million on any exit (that you share with your other execs). Or maybe you just negotiate that your ownership should be 15% of the company (vs. the standard 4–6% for a hired-gun CEO).\n\nSource: \"Raising Startup Capital.pdf - Page 3\"\nThe equity investor is much more involved in the management and operations of the funded  venture.

You need shots on goal as not every one will go in the back of the net. The right number of deals will depend on your strategy. If you’re a seed fund that takes 5–10% ownership and doesn’t take board seats you might have 50, 100 or even 200 investments. If you’re a later-stage fund that comes in when there’s less upside but a lower “loss ratio” you might have only 8–12 investments in a fund. If you’re an angel investor you should figure out how much money you can afford to lose and then figure out how to pace your money over a set period of time (say 2–3 years) and come up with how many companies you think is diversified for you and then back into how many $ to write / company.

Instead, given the facts I was given, my feedback was to run far away, fast. Entrepreneurs – beware. This is the kind of behavior that gives investors a bad name.

People do what people do. You have money, you spend it. And there are consequences for spending too much money. I was always fond of saying about fund raising, “When the hor d’oeuvres tray is passed take two and put one in your pocket for later. Just don’t take the whole tray.” My analogy was that there are markets where it’s relatively easier to raise capital and therefore you should take a little bit more but you should create a budget where you only spend 70% of what you raise on a pace of 18 months. But people never do. Justin is right. I know it sounds crazy but at the earliest stages of a company your valuation often is determined by how much money you raise. There is a general guideline of how much investors want to own in order to invest in your company and the norm is 15–30% with the most common range 20–25% per early stage round. So the temptation would be to ask for $5 million because that implies a $20 million pre-money valuation if you’re able to only give away 20% or a $15 million pre-money valuation of investors require 25%.

The female-led firm was Inspired Capital, led by Penny Pritzker, the former Secretary of Commerce under President Barack Obama, and Alexa Von Tobel, the former founder and CEO of Learnvest. The instructor may then ask, “Given the team’s choice for the amount of capital they decided to raise, what are the implications for Chief moving forward?”  Student responses may include the following:  Chief needs to grow rapidly to justify the higher valuation implied by the amount of funding it had just raised. Childers and Kaplan must make significant progress with the company’s expansion and prove to investors that the market size justifies the amount of capital raised. Childers and Kaplan must prioritize building a management team that can support scaling.  The team must ensure that Chief crafts different customer acquisition and retention strategies according to different cities. The team should also be open to tailoring aspects of the product offering, such as the clubhouse or small group meeting structures, to best accommodate local dynamics. As they expand, Childers and Kaplan should be mindful of the unique city-by-city market dynamics.  Childers and Kaplan must create Chief’s digital platform to build a more scalable and holistic\n\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 32/37\"\nefficiency in building start-ups. The more capital that is raised, the more is spent on marginal initiatives. Milestone-based financing with tighter milestones and smaller buffers may lead to more discipline. Again, students may cite examples of their own experiences or that of famous startups that saw false positives in product-market fit and then scaled too aggressively (e.g., Fab.com). The instructor should then present students with a hypothetical situation in which Childers decides to pursue a blitz strategy and receives two term sheets:  Option 1: A strong valuation from a top-tier firm that is all male Option 2: A lower valuation from a new firm that is female-led The instructor should emphasize that the price difference is significant, and ask students, “Which option would you pursue?” Record student responses on Board 7. Some students may argue that Childers and Kaplan should take the option from the male firm since, as a new business, Chief needs both the capital and the power of the firm’s reputation. Other students may counter that Chief has promoted itself as a company that is committed to female empowerment and that taking the investment from the all-male firm would damage Chief’s reputation.  Some students may argue that the decision would depend on the profiles of the women at the female-led firm and may point out that the female-led firm could present important networking and membership opportunities for Chief in the future. Other students may respond that\n\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 34/37\"\nChief represents a highly sought-after investment opportunity. Thus, they have an opportunity to try to shape the negotiations such that the financing framework and participants precisely meet their needs rather than simply reacting to what investors want to do. Ultimately, founders must ensure that they have alignment between their customers, their value proposition, unit economics, branding, and their venture capital funding. All factors are interdependent and have an impact on the expansion potential and pacing of a company.   Wrap Up The instructor can then reveal which option Childers and Kaplan chose. The instructor should state that after generating a high degree of investor and member interest, they decided to blitzscale to other cities. The instructor may suggest that a possible motivating factor to support the blitzscale was the importance of first-mover advantage for securing Chief’s target audience in the new cities, given the limited market size and high switching costs associated with women’s executive networking.  The instructor may note that, in June 2019, Childers and Kaplan raised $22 million in funding, combining investments from an all-male firm and a female-led firm. As a result, Childers and Kaplan planned to expand to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., by December 2020. The instructor may wish to mention that the leader of the all-male firm was Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, who had prioritized\n\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 30/37\"\nwould join. Each piece of the business model was interdependent.  Because of this, each new city presented a winner-take-all market: only one women’s professional networking organization was likely to thrive in any given place, because only one could have the best network of women. This exacerbated the need for Chief to move quickly, lest other competitors captured the women-centric executive networking market first. On the other hand, rapid expansion might strain resources such that Chief would be unable to successfully acquire target customers in new cities.  At this point, the instructor may conclude the pasture by asking, “Have any of you changed your minds about your initial vote?” The instructor might ask respondents to explain what affected their opinions. Choosing the Right Amount of Capital—And the Right Capital Partner (15 minutes) The instructor should next shift to discuss the fundraising decision that Childers and Kaplan would face if they chose to expand. The instructor can show their decision map on Board 6, illustrating how much stake in Chief Childers and Kaplan would give up by raising different amounts of capital at varying valuations. While raising a large amount of capital gives a young company more resources, its existing owners must weigh how much ownership dilution they are willing to accept to accommodate new investors who contribute additional capital. The instructor might point out that delaying expansion would likely give Chief a higher valuation,\n\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 17/37\"\nThere was a clear demand among female executives for the services that Chief provided. For example, Sujean Lee, the COO of Milk Bar, noted that her job “was such a rewarding professional experience, but it was also stressful and intense and at times lonely. I wished I had more people who understood what I was going through” (case p. 6). Of the available executive networking services and women-centric networking services, only Chief provided the support and camaraderie that Lee and her peers sought. These sentiments were likely universal among highly successful women and indicated that Chief would have significant demand in other cities. An important factor in the question of the pacing of expansion is access to capital. At this stage of the conversation, students may raise the fact that aggressive expansion would require a large and successful fundraising round(s). Chief was not a software-based startup with any intellectual property and thus may not be as attractive to venture capitalist funders. Further, Childers and Kaplan were first-time founders. Women have historically had a difficult time accessing venture capital to fuel their start-ups. Research has shown that female entrepreneurs are asked more “prevention-focused questions” that focus on not losing capital, while male entrepreneurs are given the chance to answer more “promotion-focused questions” that focus on attaining growth.

Tory Higgins of Columbia University, published research in the Academy of Management Journal on how early conversations between VCs and entrepreneurs—specifically in the Q&A portion of the pitch—can predict future funding outcomes.  The researchers analyzed the question and answer interactions between VCs and entrepreneurs at a fundraising competition and then tracked the subsequent funding rounds for startups launched at the event. They observed that VCs of both genders posed different types of questions to male and female founders. In particular: Two thirds of questions posed to male entrepreneurs were focused on hopes and future achievements, while two thirds of questions posed to female entrepreneurs were focused on risk and responsibility. This difference in questioning led to a drastic difference in funding. While the startups they tracked were comparable in terms of quality and capital needs, they found that male-led startups in the sample raised five times more funding than female-led ones.

Kaplan needed to weigh the risks and opportunities of joining Chief. Instructors can use these role materials as the basis of a negotiation exercise that focuses on the co-founder selection process. Key issues include understanding the factors that determine whether a co-founder is needed, what qualities to search for in a co-founder, and what topics need to be discussed when beginning a start-up venture together.  “Scaling at Chief” explores events after Childers and Kaplan launched Chief. The first Chief branch opened in New York City in January 2019 and experienced immediate success. More than 1,000 women joined the waitlist in October 2018, and the number of paid members exceeded Childers and Kaplan’s annual goal by February 2019. Childers and Kaplan initially planned to focus on the New York City branch for Chief’s first year, but given early indications of demand in other cities, they considered moving up their timeline for expansion and scaling more aggressively.  At the end of the “Scaling at Chief” case, Childers and Kaplan had to decide appropriate next steps for Chief.

While expansion presented the opportunity to capitalize on Chief’s early momentum, Childers and Kaplan wondered whether to focus first on unfinished business in New York, such as filling key staff positions and building Chief’s technology platform. The technology platform would allow members to stay in touch between meetings, seek advice from the entire Chief network, and cultivate a stronger sense of community within Chief (case p. 5).

The instructor may then ask, “Given the team’s choice for the amount of capital they decided to raise, what are the implications for Chief moving forward?”  Student responses may include the following:  Chief needs to grow rapidly to justify the higher valuation implied by the amount of funding it had just raised. Childers and Kaplan must make significant progress with the company’s expansion and prove to investors that the market size justifies the amount of capital raised. Childers and Kaplan must prioritize building a management team that can support scaling.  The team must ensure that Chief crafts different customer acquisition and retention strategies according to different cities. The team should also be open to tailoring aspects of the product offering, such as the clubhouse or small group meeting structures, to best accommodate local dynamics.

Some students may argue that life is funky and funny both at the same time. Other students may say that Chief has promoted itself as a company that is committed to female empowerment and that taking the investment from the all-male firm would damage Chief’s reputation.

The researchers analyzed the question and answer interactions between VCs and entrepreneurs at a fundraising competition and then tracked the subsequent funding rounds for startups launched at the event. They observed that VCs of both genders posed different types of questions to male and female founders. In particular: Two thirds of questions posed to male entrepreneurs were focused on hopes and future achievements, while two thirds of questions posed to female entrepreneurs were focused on risk and responsibility. This difference in questioning led to a drastic difference in funding. While the startups they tracked were comparable in terms of quality and capital needs, they found that male-led startups in the sample raised five times more funding than female-led ones.

MCGINN   JULIA KELLEY   KATHERINE CHEN   Scaling at Chief   In late February  2019,  just months  after  their  network  for women  executives  offici ally launched,   Chief  co-founders  Carolyn Childers and Lindsay Kaplan  prepared  to meet  with  one of their  investors   in New York  City to talk about  their  financing  and operating  plans  for the coming  year. As they  waited   in Chief’s recently  renovated, members -only  Tribeca  Clubhouse,  the two co-founders  were amazed  by  how  much  they  had accomplished.  (See Exhibit 1 for photos  of Chief’s  Clubhouse.)   Childers and Kaplan  had first met to discuss Chief  in 2018.  Over  coffee, Childers shared her initial   vision  for Chie f, an organization  that would  provide  support  to women executives  at the vice president   (VP)  and C-suite  level.  She explained  how  the vast majority  of these  executives  had reached a stage  in  their  career where they  were more  isolated,  often as the only  woman  in the room.  (See Exhibit  2 for a  pitch  deck  slide  summarizing the reasons  for launching  Chief.)  This  experience was personal  for  Childers and Kaplan,  each  of whom had risen  to the senior  vice president  (SVP) level  in male - dominated  startups —Handy  and Casper, respectively. Childers  was in itially unsure  about whether   she should  launch Chief  alone  or with  a co-founder,  but Kaplan,  with  her brand  and marketing\n\nSource: \"ENTRE_M5_BV3_02.22.2023_READY FOR BETA.docx - 13/119\"\nBusiness School, Mark Conley of Stockholm School of Economics, and E. Tory Higgins of Columbia University, published research in the Academy of Management Journal on how early conversations between VCs and entrepreneurs—specifically in the Q&A portion of the pitch—can predict future funding outcomes.  The researchers analyzed the question and answer interactions between VCs and entrepreneurs at a fundraising competition and then tracked the subsequent funding rounds for startups launched at the event. \"As the sun set, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, a young girl sat by the window, lost in the enchanting world of the book she was reading, oblivious to the world outside.\" is what one venture capitalist said to the other.

Kaplan needed to weigh the risks and opportunities of joining Chief. Instructors can use these role materials as the basis of a negotiation exercise that focuses on the co-founder selection process. Key issues include understanding the factors that determine whether a co-founder is needed, what qualities to search for in a co-founder, and what topics need to be discussed when beginning a start-up venture together.  “Scaling at Chief” explores events after Childers and Kaplan launched Chief. The first Chief branch opened in New York City in January 2019 and experienced immediate success. More than 1,000 women joined the waitlist in October 2018, and the number of paid members exceeded Childers and Kaplan’s annual goal by February 2019. Childers and Kaplan initially planned to focus on the New York City branch for Chief’s first year, but given early indications of demand in other cities, they considered moving up their timeline for expansion and scaling more aggressively.  At the end of the “Scaling at Chief” case, Childers and Kaplan had to decide appropriate next steps for Chief. They could undertake a moderate strategy in which they raise a modest amount of capital and expand to two additional cities, Boston and Washington, DC; they could raise a larger amount of capital and\n\nSource: \"Chief Teaching Plan.docx - 3/37\"\nThey could undertake a moderate strategy in which they raise a modest amount of capital and expand to two additional cities, Boston and Washington, DC; they could raise a larger amount of capital and aggressively expand to five cities by adding Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco; or they could pursue their original plan to focus exclusively on New York City to develop their nascent offering and operations and avoid the distraction of fundraising altogether. While expansion presented the opportunity to capitalize on Chief’s early momentum, Childers and Kaplan wondered whether to focus first on unfinished business in New York, such as filling key staff positions and building Chief’s technology platform. The technology platform would allow members to stay in touch between meetings, seek advice from the entire Chief network, and cultivate a stronger sense of community within Chief (case p. 5). Childers and Kaplan also needed to determine how to mitigate the operational and quality risks involved with a more rapid expansion.   Instructors can use this collection of cases to illustrate the decision points that a young company faces. First, how does one identify the right co-founder, and what are best practices for negotiating with a potential co-founder? After early successes, what should founders factor into strategic and operational decisions about growth? What factors should be given weight in decisions about raising second round capital?

    "answer": "The Squire business model is appealing due to its focus on a niche yet underserved market - barbershops. The company started with a simple software product and then expanded its offerings to include additional services, such as financial services, to increase the average revenue per user (ARPU), customer lifetime value (LTV), and total addressable market (TAM). This approach is known as the vertical SaaS playbook, which has proven successful for many companies. \n\nHowever, the founders of Squire faced difficulties in raising their seed round due to several reasons. Firstly, investors were skeptical about the size of the market Squire was targeting. The barbershop industry is fragmented and governed by different state laws, making it challenging to scale. Secondly, the founders lacked technical experience and had early struggles in building their product. They also faced issues with their business model, as it did not work well for all barbershop business models. Lastly, there were concerns about the unit economics of the business. \n\nIn addition to these business-related challenges, there were also potential biases against the founders, who are Black. Despite their strong credentials, they faced disrespect in meetings with investors and had to jump through extra hoops to raise money.",

Another business issue that investors might raise to Squire came from the discussion of different barbershop business models on case pp. 4-6. Squire did not work well for barbers who used the common rent-a-chair business model (case p. 6). In addition, to ensure the greatest customer satisfaction and engagement with Squire, the company required barbershops to stop using other booking or payments systems they had in place. This allowed Squire to deeply embed its product in barbershops’ workflows but could be a barrier to adoption for some shops, especially shops that were not run by tech-savvy owners or did not serve a tech-savvy clientele. Salvant and LaRon also faced early struggles to find tech talent and to build their product. The two founders were first-timers with zero entrepreneurial experience, lacked tech experience and expertise, and their early attempts to hire developers all failed. One developer was a known conman who tried to steal their money (case p. 3). Although they probably did not reveal that mistake to investors, many investors prefer at least one member of a founding team to have product development experience.

Pedagogical Overview The case presents students with two distinct but related challenges: evaluating Squire’s business model and assessing to what extent race may have played a role in the founders’ early struggles to raise capital. It is clear from the case facts that investors’ views about Squire’s potential have improved dramatically over the first six years. Squire has made progress in running the vertical SaaS playbook, but still has untapped avenues. To what extent was early investor pessimism due to legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model, and to what extent was it due to racial bias?  Squire’s Business Model Students can begin their investigation by assessing the merits and weaknesses of Squire’s business model from a variety of angles. The case allows for an especially rich discussion of three components of Squire’s business model: market sizing, unit economics, and the evolution of unit economics illuminated via cohort analysis. Beyond the present context of assessing the strength of Squire’s business model, these are necessary tools for any founder, and applying them to Squire will serve as a valuable introduction or refresher.

See the Andreesen Horowitz blog post in the Recommended Additional Readings section for more on this topic. Racial Bias in Venture Capital and Venture-Backed Entrepreneurship A central theme throughout the case is the founders’ struggle to raise VC in their early days. The questions students are left with are: To what extent is this accounted for by legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model and prospects, and to what extent is this the result of implicit or explicit bias against Black founders? As the above analysis indicates, there was room to doubt Squire’s success in the early days. However, there is always room to doubt the success of early-stage ventures—indeed Jesse Middleton, WeWork cofounder and Squire’s first angel investor, says in the case (p. 4), “[W]hen you’re investing in early-stage prototypes, you look for one or two reasons to invest, not the hundreds of reasons not to.” And as for Salvant’s assessment of the causes of Squire’s early\n\nSource: \"LTV 2022 Slack.docx - 99/214\"\nfew investors would have known that was possible (founders included). And in this case, did Squire get lucky? Which early-stage investor would have betted that these founders would have been able to get such loyal customers and get so much revenue in a fairly unproven business model?The fact that early-stage investing is not clear cut with few indicators is probably why so many VC funds look to others for validation and signaling and explains why within 7mo a company can get a 5x step-up in valuation. I struggled with the fact that one person / fund can change the trajectory of the business and if they had not received any initial funding – where would the business be today? How much of a startup’s success is based on the founder pedigree and ability to fundraise vs. the actual business? I wonder if there is a way to neutralize biases (especially when it is done at a widescale level) – perhaps through more standardized data and sharing around valuations and metrics? How has the industry worked to rectify systematic biases since this case was written? Also, I would love to talk more about how VC funds think about sharing allocation and looking to other funds for signals – has this led to successful outcomes?

Another business issue that investors might raise to Squire came from the discussion of different barbershop business models on case pp. 4-6. Squire did not work well for barbers who used the common rent-a-chair business model (case p. 6). In addition, to ensure the greatest customer satisfaction and engagement with Squire, the company required barbershops to stop using other booking or payments systems they had in place. This allowed Squire to deeply embed its product in barbershops’ workflows but could be a barrier to adoption for some shops, especially shops that were not run by tech-savvy owners or did not serve a tech-savvy clientele. Salvant and LaRon also faced early struggles to find tech talent and to build their product. The two founders were first-timers with zero entrepreneurial experience, lacked tech experience and expertise, and their early attempts to hire developers all failed. One developer was a known conman who tried to steal their money (case p. 3). Although they probably did not reveal that mistake to investors, many investors prefer at least one member of a founding team to have product development experience. Students may also raise the challenging unit economics, on the surface. Those unit economics may come up at this point in the discussion (see below) or later when the instructor asks for a more detailed assessment of the quality of the business model (below).\n\nSource: \"ENTRE_M2_BV3_05_17_2023 Jeff W1 Changes.docx - 39/136\"\nwere very early in their startup journey and came with a $20,000 grant. Once they finished this three to four-month program, the co-founders were accepted into the YC Core program along with roughly 100 other startups. To compete in the program, the pair moved from New York City to San Francisco, California, for the summer. They took this opportunity to reach out to barbers in the area, sign them up to use the Squire app, and gather more information on usage. At the end of the summer, all founders enrolled in the YC Core program had the opportunity to pitch their startups to investors at an event called “demo day.” The purpose of the pitch event was to generate interest in their startup from investors and secure capital. Dave and Songe brought in a barber chair for the event and gave free haircuts to potential investors while pitching the Squire business model. They pitched between 75 and 100 investors but struggled to generate any interest or funding compared to other founders in their YC cohort.  For the following video, take note of what gave investors pause about the Squire business and why.   Songe LaRon and Dave Salvant, Squire [00:24:48.15] SONGE LARON: Yeah, so at first, market size was always an issue that frankly, we struggled with because this industry is very underserved, and it's very fragmented, and it's governed by state law, which means there's 50 different laws that apply to barbershops.

Pedagogical Overview The case presents students with two distinct but related challenges: evaluating Squire’s business model and assessing to what extent race may have played a role in the founders’ early struggles to raise capital. It is clear from the case facts that investors’ views about Squire’s potential have improved dramatically over the first six years. Squire has made progress in running the vertical SaaS playbook, but still has untapped avenues. To what extent was early investor pessimism due to legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model, and to what extent was it due to racial bias?  Squire’s Business Model Students can begin their investigation by assessing the merits and weaknesses of Squire’s business model from a variety of angles. The case allows for an especially rich discussion of three components of Squire’s business model: market sizing, unit economics, and the evolution of unit economics illuminated via cohort analysis. Beyond the present context of assessing the strength of Squire’s business model, these are necessary tools for any founder, and applying them to Squire will serve as a valuable introduction or refresher.

This pattern of penetrating a vertical market with a simple SaaS product and then adding additional follow-on products, including financial services, to expand ARPU, LTV, and TAM is essentially the vertical SaaS playbook. Squire has the opportunity to execute this playbook with barbershops, and this case is an opportunity to learn that playbook for this particular vertical industry. See the Andreesen Horowitz blog post in the Recommended Additional Readings section for more on this topic. Racial Bias in Venture Capital and Venture-Backed Entrepreneurship A central theme throughout the case is the founders’ struggle to raise VC in their early days. The questions students are left with are: To what extent is this accounted for by legitimate concerns about Squire’s business model and prospects, and to what extent is this the result of implicit or explicit bias against Black founders? As the above analysis indicates, there was room to doubt Squire’s success in the early days. However, there is always room to doubt the success of early-stage ventures—indeed Jesse Middleton, WeWork cofounder and Squire’s first angel investor, says in the case (p. 4), “[W]hen you’re investing in early-stage prototypes, you look for one or two reasons to invest, not the hundreds of reasons not to.” And as for Salvant’s assessment of the causes of Squire’s early\n\nSource: \"LTV 2022 Slack.docx - 99/214\"\nfew investors would have known that was possible (founders included). And in this case, did Squire get lucky? Which early-stage investor would have betted that these founders would have been able to get such loyal customers and get so much revenue in a fairly unproven business model?The fact that early-stage investing is not clear cut with few indicators is probably why so many VC funds look to others for validation and signaling and explains why within 7mo a company can get a 5x step-up in valuation. I struggled with the fact that one person / fund can change the trajectory of the business and if they had not received any initial funding – where would the business be today? How much of a startup’s success is based on the founder pedigree and ability to fundraise vs. the actual business? I wonder if there is a way to neutralize biases (especially when it is done at a widescale level) – perhaps through more standardized data and sharing around valuations and metrics? How has the industry worked to rectify systematic biases since this case was written? Also, I would love to talk more about how VC funds think about sharing allocation and looking to other funds for signals – has this led to successful outcomes? In some ways this seems like a boy’s club where people who are friends just give deals to each other and share their research, and another way to perpetuate biases… (edited)  Jeffrey Bussgang  5:42 PM On the question from @Amna Ali regarding right and wrong with respect\n\nSource: \"Squire Teaching Note.docx - 16/34\"\nSalvant, case p.4 Lack of tech experience/expertise on the founding team; early struggles building their product                            Disrespected in meetings with investors Barbershops are often a low-tech business and thus slow to adopt technology into their business processes                 Strong credentials – JPMorgan, Yale Law, Y Combinator – White entrepreneurs with those credentials would not struggle to raise seed money Not every barbershop business model works equally well with Squire—thus, the small TAM would be further diminished        Jumping through hoops to raise money – YC fellowship before they could do the “real YC,” moving to Buffalo to get $650K Talk about, but no evidence of, adding follow-on products and services such as fintech elements (e.g., payments, credit)  Rich investors may not see the pain points that normal people face getting a haircut                                                                                                                           Investors see this as a business for Black barbershops, further reducing the TAM in their minds Source:\tCasewriter.

Few criteria (amongst many) for successful venture funding for early-stage companies are : 1) founder charisma/background/market fit 2) large TAM/SAM – large growing market with a reasonable assumption around percentage of market share needed to be a scaled business 3) whitespace opportunity / skew propensity.

    "answer": "The KhataBook case revolves around several key issues. The first is the company's approach to monetization. As of January 2020, KhataBook, a digital ledger app for small businesses in India, had not generated any revenues or determined its ultimate business model, despite having raised $26.7 million through seed funding and a Series A round. The company had focused on customer acquisition and retention, as well as running a series of monetization experiments. Potential monetization opportunities considered by the company included lending as a service, a freemium model, and advertising. \n\nThe second issue is the timing of KhataBook's monetization efforts. The case compares KhataBook's situation to other startups, some of which faced less pressure from investors to monetize. For instance, Codecademy, an online platform offering coding classes, had the support of its investors in strategically delaying monetization experiments.\n\nThe third issue is the ethical choices made by KhataBook's co-founder and CEO, Ravish Naresh. The case discusses Naresh's aggressive competition strategies, such as copying a peer's concept, using images without permission in marketing campaigns, and attempting to steal away a competitor's funding.\n\nLastly, the case also touches on the challenges of operating at the bottom of the pyramid. KhataBook's target customers were small retail shops known as kirana shops, a segment that had seen an increase in digitalization of merchant and financial services due to the explosive growth of internet use in India. However, the question remained whether these customers valued the service enough to have a strong willingness to pay, thus affecting the company's total addressable market.",

Intent on raising a Series B funding round, Naresh considered monetization opportunities, including lending as a service, a freemium model, advertising, and others, while also increasing app downloads and post-install usage. But as a small team of only 40 employees, Naresh would need to choose his priorities carefully. Case Positioning This case is used in Launching Technology Ventures (LTV), an elective curriculum course for second-year MBA students at Harvard Business School. LTV was designed for students who plan to start their own companies, join early-stage startups, work at growth-stage technology firms, or invest in startups. This case is part of LTV\u2019s third module, focused on business model experiments. As the module\u2019s final case, it serves as a bridge case to connect to the course\u2019s fourth module focused on financing, exits, and ethics. The case is appropriate for MBA and executive education audiences, as well as undergraduate courses on entrepreneurship or startup business models. Teaching Objectives The KhataBook case is intended to show students:  The importance of product-led growth as a technique to drive customer adoption and some of the design principles inherent in that strategy, including virality and a user experience that drives repeated usage. The criticality of the quality of growth, not just quantity.

The criticality of the quality of growth, not just quantity. Adding users that disengage shortly after product trial leads to a \u201cleaky bucket\u201d phenomenon. This case pushes students to look beyond headling-grabbing, \u201cvanity metrics\u201d and understand the underlying usage metrics that drive loyalty and value. Reinforce the concept that startups are experimentation machines and a founder\u2019s choice of experiments is a strategic one. Startup experiments occur within an envelope of time and money and, thus, the sequencing of the experiments\u2014in this case growth then usage then monetization\u2014is critical. As it is set in India, this case also provides students with a vehicle to explore the different rules and playbooks that founders face in developing countries. For example, using capital as a competitive weapon and securing funding from one of the few large capital providers is even more critical than in a developed country where capital and prospective investors are more abundant. Finally, KhataBook describes a founder who pushes the limits of aggressive competition and ethical behavior\u2014copying a peer\u2019s concept, using images without permission in marketing campaigns, trying to steal away a competitor\u2019s funding. Thus, the case provides a platform to discuss the boundaries of ethics in entrepreneurship. Assignment Questions How would you characterize KhataBook\u2019s approach to monetization?

They, in turn, may then begin using KhataBook\u2019s bookkeeping features. Likewise, the overall retention rate could increase, as new users that downloaded the app for the bookkeeping function could stick with the app if it added e-commerce features. Pasture Two: Bottom of the Pyramid (20 minutes) Transition to the second pasture with an assessment of KhataBook\u2019s existing market. Ask: Why is KhataBook a real opportunity in 2019 versus five years ago? Students should refer to Case pp. 2-3, noting that digital adoption lagged among KhataBook\u2019s target customers, kirana shop owners, and other small business owners. However, the explosive growth of internet use in India due to declining smartphone prices and increased online penetration driven by Reliance Jio had seen an increase in digitalization of merchant and financial services.  Follow up, asking students a more provocative question, Can you build a big business at the bottom of the pyramid? Or are KhataBook\u2019s target customers willing to use a free app but do not value the service enough to have a strong willingness to pay (WTP), lifetime value (LTV), and thus total addressable market (TAM)? Record responses on the board, as displayed on Board Three in Board Plan, p. 10. Responses may include: Yes.

In the case of KhataBook, the core action is for a merchant to use the app to record a transaction with another merchant, which, if done correctly, can kick off a viral loop as the receiving merchant must get the app to receive the information electronically. Next, the class can discuss monetization experiments that founders run to test different aspects of their business model and the timing of those experiments. To contrast the forthcoming discussion of KhataBook, review examples of startups that faced less pressure from investors to monetize.

Operating in a fast-moving, competitive market, KhataBook could focus on customer acquisition, customer retention, or running a series of monetization experiments. Since its launch in 2018, KhataBook had raised $26.7 million through seed funding and a Series A round. By executing on product-led growth techniques, the startup had grown rapidly as measured by downloads and transactions. Yet, it had not generated any revenues or even determined its ultimate business model.

I came to the class thinking that Khatabook has a bleak chance to survive, because of a) low WTP for anything amongst shopkeepers (my Dad is a Kirana shop owner in India!), b) huge competition in lending services as\u00a0@Raghav Gupta\u00a0 mentioned and c) lack of high quality data to underwrite risk. However, I was surprised by a few milestones Khatabook has achieved post the case - supported 10M merchants through the pandemic, currently operating at 600K monthly app installs all through the WOM (seriously!!), Ravish\u2019s fundraising ability (raised >175M$ now) for Khatabook. Overall, it looks like a VC money fueled product growth, but the sustainability story is yet to be told. There are still huge risks for the business. Ravish mentioned, during the coffee chat that he\u2019s calibrating his mindset to build a business (he\u2019s built products last 15 years but not business). Khatabook is still building human capital in the org to build",

Intent on raising a Series B funding round, Naresh considered monetization opportunities, including lending as a service, a freemium model, advertising, and others, while also increasing app downloads and post-install usage. But as a small team of only 40 employees, Naresh would need to choose his priorities carefully. Case Positioning This case is used in Launching Technology Ventures (LTV), an elective curriculum course for second-year MBA students at Harvard Business School. LTV was designed for students who plan to start their own companies, join early-stage startups, work at growth-stage technology firms, or invest in startups. This case is part of LTV\u2019s third module, focused on business model experiments. As the module\u2019s final case, it serves as a bridge case to connect to the course\u2019s fourth module focused on financing, exits, and ethics. The case is appropriate for MBA and executive education audiences, as well as undergraduate courses on entrepreneurship or startup business models. Teaching Objectives The KhataBook case is intended to show students:  The importance of product-led growth as a technique to drive customer adoption and some of the design principles inherent in that strategy, including virality and a user experience that drives repeated usage. The criticality of the quality of growth, not just quantity. Adding users that disengage shortly after product trial\n\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 4/20\"\nstrategy, including virality and a user experience that drives repeated usage. The criticality of the quality of growth, not just quantity. Adding users that disengage shortly after product trial leads to a \u201cleaky bucket\u201d phenomenon. This case pushes students to look beyond headling-grabbing, \u201cvanity metrics\u201d and understand the underlying usage metrics that drive loyalty and value. Reinforce the concept that startups are experimentation machines and a founder\u2019s choice of experiments is a strategic one. Startup experiments occur within an envelope of time and money and, thus, the sequencing of the experiments\u2014in this case growth then usage then monetization\u2014is critical. As it is set in India, this case also provides students with a vehicle to explore the different rules and playbooks that founders face in developing countries. For example, using capital as a competitive weapon and securing funding from one of the few large capital providers is even more critical than in a developed country where capital and prospective investors are more abundant. Finally, KhataBook describes a founder who pushes the limits of aggressive competition and ethical behavior\u2014copying a peer\u2019s concept, using images without permission in marketing campaigns, trying to steal away a competitor\u2019s funding. Thus, the case provides a platform to discuss the boundaries of ethics in entrepreneurship. Assignment Questions How would you characterize KhataBook\u2019s approach to monetization? Compare KhataBook\u2019s\n\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 12/20\"\nuse the app to take and receive orders with other users. They, in turn, may then begin using KhataBook\u2019s bookkeeping features. Likewise, the overall retention rate could increase, as new users that downloaded the app for the bookkeeping function could stick with the app if it added e-commerce features. Pasture Two: Bottom of the Pyramid (20 minutes) Transition to the second pasture with an assessment of KhataBook\u2019s existing market. Ask: Why is KhataBook a real opportunity in 2019 versus five years ago? Students should refer to Case pp. 2-3, noting that digital adoption lagged among KhataBook\u2019s target customers, kirana shop owners, and other small business owners. However, the explosive growth of internet use in India due to declining smartphone prices and increased online penetration driven by Reliance Jio had seen an increase in digitalization of merchant and financial services.  Follow up, asking students a more provocative question, Can you build a big business at the bottom of the pyramid? Or are KhataBook\u2019s target customers willing to use a free app but do not value the service enough to have a strong willingness to pay (WTP), lifetime value (LTV), and thus total addressable market (TAM)? Record responses on the board, as displayed on Board Three in Board Plan, p. 10. Responses may include: Yes. Per p. 3 of the case, focusing on B2B small merchant services was a popular and valuable space for investment in India. Many kirana merchants record their transactions manually\n\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 6/20\"\nTwo: Bottom of the Pyramid 20 minutes\tPasture Three: Ethical Choices 10 minutes\tWrap Up Discussion Plan Pasture One: Monetization Experiments (30 minutes) The instructor should open the case by reviewing Naresh\u2019s situation in January 2020 as KhataBook races to become India\u2019s preeminent digital ledger app. KhataBook secured Series A funding in September 2019 and had focused on usage, or \u201cbottom of the funnel\u201d growth (case p. 7). Consider referencing Tavel\u2019s Hierarchy of Engagement, as displayed on Board One in Board Plan, p. 10, from Sarah Tavel\u2019s framework to evaluate non-transactional consumer companies and the importance of getting users to perform the core action\u2014that is, the essence or foundation of the product and its value proposition. In the case of KhataBook, the core action is for a merchant to use the app to record a transaction with another merchant, which, if done correctly, can kick off a viral loop as the receiving merchant must get the app to receive the information electronically. Next, the class can discuss monetization experiments that founders run to test different aspects of their business model and the timing of those experiments. To contrast the forthcoming discussion of KhataBook, review examples of startups that faced less pressure from investors to monetize. For example, investors of Codecademy, an online platform offering coding classes, were supportive of Codecademy strategically delaying monetization experiments. KhataBook, on the other hand,\n\nSource: \"LTV 2022 - All Case Takeaways.pdf - Page 86\"\nKhatabook \u2013The Issues \u2022Product -led growth / flywheel \u2022Hierarchy of Engagement \u2022Monetization timing \u2022Operating at the bottom of the pyramid \u2022Startup playbook and financing in developing  markets \u2022Ethical choices of founders \u2013\u201chustler\u201d vs. \u201cunethical behavior\u201d\n\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 5/20\"\nThus, the case provides a platform to discuss the boundaries of ethics in entrepreneurship.

Intent on raising a Series B funding round, Naresh considered monetization opportunities, including lending as a service, a freemium model, advertising, and others, while also increasing app downloads and post-install usage. But as a small team of only 40 employees, Naresh would need to choose his priorities carefully. Case Positioning This case is used in Launching Technology Ventures (LTV), an elective curriculum course for second-year MBA students at Harvard Business School. LTV was designed for students who plan to start their own companies, join early-stage startups, work at growth-stage technology firms, or invest in startups. This case is part of LTV\u2019s third module, focused on business model experiments. After the successful execution of the previous business plans, the team was brimming with optimism for their future plans. The feedback they had received from their clients had strengthened their belief in the product they were building. Furthermore, the exponential growth in their user base was a testament to the potential the product had in the market. They had successfully identified a gap in the market and their product was meeting the demands of that gap effectively. The journey had been challenging, but the results were gratifying. The company was not just financially successful but also influential in shaping industry trends. The digital revolution has ushered in an era of unprecedented access to information and has drastically reduced the costs of communication. This has had a profound impact on all aspects of our lives, from how we work to how we socialize and learn. In the world of business, the digital revolution has levelled the playing field, allowing small startups to compete with large established firms. One of the key factors in this transformation has been the advent of digital marketing, which has given businesses of all sizes the ability to reach a global audience at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing methods. The growth of social media has further amplified this impact, providing a platform for businesses to engage with their customers in a more personal and direct manner.\n\nSource: \"KhataBook Teaching Plan.docx - 12/20\"\nuse the app to take and receive orders with other users. They, in turn, may then begin using KhataBook\u2019s bookkeeping features. Likewise, the overall retention rate could increase, as new users that downloaded the app for the bookkeeping function could stick with the app if it added e-commerce features. Pasture Two: Bottom of the Pyramid (20 minutes) Transition to the second pasture with an assessment of KhataBook\u2019s existing market. Ask: Why is KhataBook a real opportunity in 2019 versus five years ago? Students should refer to Case pp. 2-3, noting that digital adoption lagged among KhataBook\u2019s target customers, kirana shop owners, and other small business owners. However, the explosive growth of internet use in India due to declining smartphone prices and increased online penetration driven by Reliance Jio had seen an increase in digitalization of merchant and financial services.  Follow up, asking students a more provocative question, Can you build a big business at the bottom of the pyramid? Or are KhataBook\u2019s target customers willing to use a free app but do not value the service enough to have a strong willingness to pay (WTP), lifetime value (LTV), and thus total addressable market (TAM)? Record responses on the board, as displayed on Board Three in Board Plan, p. 10. Responses may include: Yes.

Consider referencing Tavel\u2019s Hierarchy of Engagement, as displayed on Board One in Board Plan, p. 10, from Sarah Tavel\u2019s framework to evaluate non-transactional consumer companies and the importance of getting users to perform the core action\u2014that is, the essence or foundation of the product and its value proposition. In the case of KhataBook, the core action is for a merchant to use the app to record a transaction with another merchant, which, if done correctly, can kick off a viral loop as the receiving merchant must get the app to receive the information electronically. Next, the class can discuss monetization experiments that founders run to test different aspects of their business model and the timing of those experiments. To contrast the forthcoming discussion of KhataBook, review examples of startups that faced less pressure from investors to monetize. For example, investors of Codecademy, an online platform offering coding classes, were supportive of Codecademy strategically delaying monetization experiments. KhataBook, on the other hand,\n\nSource: \"LTV 2022 - All Case Takeaways.pdf - Page 86\"\nThere were many things that happened there and many things that definitely didn't happen.

Khatabook can generate a lot of value for creditors by both being able to provide access to underserved mom and pop stores across rural India, and also having the data to filter/identify those most suitable for credit. Capturing a share of the value thus created for creditors opens up a viable monetization opportunity.

I came to the class thinking that Khatabook has a bleak chance to survive, because of a) low WTP for anything amongst shopkeepers (my Dad is a Kirana shop owner in India!), b) huge competition in lending services as\u00a0@Raghav Gupta\u00a0 mentioned and c) lack of high quality data to underwrite risk. However, I was surprised by a few milestones Khatabook has achieved post the case - supported 10M merchants through the pandemic, currently operating at 600K monthly app installs all through the WOM (seriously!!), Ravish\u2019s fundraising ability (raised >175M$ now) for Khatabook. Overall, it looks like a VC money fueled product growth, but the sustainability story is yet to be told. There are still huge risks for the business.

    "answer": "When determining if a startup is an appropriate early-stage investment opportunity, you should consider the following factors: \n\n1. Team: Assess the founding team's ability to articulate a compelling vision, their integrity, and whether they inspire you and others around them. \n\n2. Market: Evaluate if the market the company is operating in is massive (i.e., greater than $1 billion in revenue potential), experiencing disruption that might lead to opportunity for a new entrant like this startup, and how crowded the market is. \n\n3. Business Model: Check if the unit economics are attractive, if the company can articulate the lifetime value of each customer, the acquisition cost of each customer, and compare the two. \n\n4. Stage of the Startup: Understand the operational maturity, cash position, and path to growth for the company. The stage of a startup will reflect the skills needed for hires as well. \n\n5. Resilience and Attitude: Look for resilience and a can-do attitude in the team. \n\n6. Risk: Be aware that early-stage startups are more likely to fail or go sideways, and you may be looking for another job in a year or two. \n\n7. Experimentation: Consider if the startup is willing to experiment and test their business model components, especially the most controversial ones. \n\n8. Long-term Value Creation: Early-stage startups are typically technology-driven with deep Intellectual Property (IP). If the technology works, value is created. The holding period for early-stage startups is typically 6-8 years, so an episodic recession shouldn't materially affect long-term value creation, so long as follow-on financing is available.",

I\u2019ve sometimes been right about the market value but too early. And I\u2019ve been spot on with both but backed the 2nd, 3rd or 4th best player in a market.

Do your  own due diligence, and don\u2019t be afraid to be cynical about the spin  you hear about a particular startup in the media versus the reality  inside the four walls. How does an outsider conduct due diligence like an insider? Use the rubric that all investors use. Evaluate each company along the same criteria we venture capitalists employ,  which are typically three simple ones.With the prospect of raising capital, the founders were uncertain about its allocation. Mirroring dilemmas faced by many bootstrapped founders, they considered whether to cash in some or most of the money by selling their shares. Alternatively, should they reinvest in product development and customer success, following a Product Led Growth strategy to enhance company value more rapidly? Or should they prioritize building a robust sales and marketing team, akin to companies like Atlassian, Dropbox, Slack, and Zoom in their scaling phase? Moreover, they contemplated how their hiring strategy should change, as they planned to substantially expand the team size.\n\nSource: \"Entering Startup Land.pdf - Page 213\"\nmultiple roles, grow more rapidly, and have more senior exposure.  The downside is that you are less likely to have great mentors from whom you can learn as compared to a larger startup. Further, it is more likely that this early-stage startup will fail or go sideways and you will be looking for another job in a year or two. If you are  willing to take more risk and operate with greater uncertainty, the  quality of the experience at the early-stage startup can be superior to that of being a small cog in the larger, hot startup. This series of steps\u2014picking your domain, your city, the stage  you\u2019re most interested in, and companies within that city that fit  that stage in that sector\u2014generally results in a very small list.

Having a mix of blinker and thinker traits (as defined by Malcolm Gladwell) will help as well. The stage of a start-up will reflect the skills needed for hires as well. Early stage startups working on a friends and family / initial investment are different than those who've closed a series A, and those who've secured a series B round behave even differently.

The concept of low-code and no-code software development, although a niche market in 2012, was gaining traction by 2018. However, Haas and Straschnov felt a sense of accomplishment in their cautious approach so far.

Scroll down Steve Blank\u2019s list  as well for links to different survey  software/service providers. In FIELD3 and PM101, we\u2019ve seen students  create poorly designed surveys with confusing and/or leading questions.   Students also often choose convenience samples \u2014 e.g., of classmates/friends who aren\u2019t in their target customer group \u2014 that yield biased results. Don\u2019t  make these mistakes!     \u2022 Analysis of rivals\u2019 features*: The book Observing the User Experience  includes a chapter on competitor research. Your task would be to  analyze  the feature sets for rivals to a startup, and make recommendations on  whether the startup should change or adapt its product in response to  findings.     \u2022 Usability test*: To run a usability test, all you need is an app/website, a  target task to complete, and a test subject or two. Tom Eisenmann\u2019s Product  Design resource list includes a section on usability testing; the books  Observing the User Experience and UX for Lean Startups discuss usability  testing at length; and we particularly recommend Steve Krug's book Rocket  Surgery Made Easy , which is a short, practical, and funny guide to the basics  of usability research.

You should only  attempt to develop personas after you have a deep understanding of  prospective customers and their needs. Your project output should include  not only the personas themselves, but also discussions of their implications  for product development and/or marketing  efforts.     \u2022 User stories**: User stories are the basic building blocks of agile software  development.  If you have  a concept  for a website or an application that has  advanced to the wireframing stage, your course project could focus on generating user stories. Mike Cohn\u2019s book User Stories Applied  offers good  guidance on the why/how of developing user stories. To close the  learning  loop on a project that has user stories as its output, you should show yo ur  stories  to a programmer and get feedback  on whether  they  would  be useful  as guides for her/his  work.     \u2022 Feature  prioritization  criteria:  Every product  team  wrestles  with  creating  a  process to prioritize engineering work.

Tom Eisenmann\u2019s Product Design  resource list includes a long section on conducting such customer discovery  interviews. Steve Blank\u2019s book, Four Steps to the Epiphany , is a seminal text  on this topic; his list of startup tools (as noted above) includes links to  videos  and many  other  resources  that will help  you \u201cget  out of the building.\u201d     \u2022 Focus groups*: Appendix A in the FIELD course note \u201c Customer Discovery  & Validation for Entrepreneurs\u201d (Cespedes, Eisenmann, Blank) offers  some  pointers on how/when/why to conduct focus groups, and you\u2019ll find more guidance online if you Google the term \u201cfocus group.\u201d The superb book  Observing the User Experience (Goodman, et al.) also devotes a chapter to  focus groups.

BUBBLE Bubble is a low-code tool for entrepreneurs to rapidly build their web-based applications founded by two entrepreneurs who have elected to bootstrap the company and not raise any capital. Six years in to their company-building journey and the company had achieved over $1 million in revenue and profitability. Just as they seem to be achieving product-market fit, the founders faced the hard question as to whether to raise their first round of outside capital\n\nSource: \"LTV Final Project Details 2022.pdf - Page 5\"\nLTV 202 2 - Course Project Memo  5  effective tool for testing demand hypotheses, as discussed in the FIELD3  course note \u201c Customer Discovery and Validation \u201d (Cespedes, Eisenmann &  Blank) and in a post  by Eric Ries.     \u2022 Personas**: Tom Eisenmann\u2019s Product Design resource list includes a  section of readings on how to create and use personas. You should only  attempt to develop personas after you have a deep understanding of  prospective customers and their needs. Your project output should include  not only the personas themselves, but also discussions of their implications  for product development and/or marketing  efforts.     \u2022 User stories**: User stories are the basic building blocks of agile software  development.  If you have  a concept  for a website or an application that has  advanced to the wireframing stage, your course project could focus on generating user stories. Mike Cohn\u2019s book User Stories Applied  offers good  guidance on the why/how of developing user stories. To close the  learning  loop on a project that has user stories as its output, you should show yo ur  stories  to a programmer and get feedback  on whether  they  would  be useful  as guides for her/his  work.     \u2022 Feature  prioritization  criteria:  Every product  team  wrestles  with  creating  a  process to prioritize engineering work.

A course  project  could   focus on: (1) aggregating and/or creating content that would be relevant to a startup\u2019s prospects and customers; (2) using social media and  other\n\nSource: \"LTV Final Project Details 2022.pdf - Page 3\"\non how to estimate LTV and CAC,  and you\u2019ll find much more on this topic online, especially pertaining to SaaS  businesses (e.g., see Tom E.\u2019s SaaS resource list ). And as you know (since it  was previously assigned to you), Jeff B. has written two blog posts on LTV  and CAC math.     Product Design and Product Management     \u2022 Customer discovery interviews** : The FIELD course note, \u201c Customer Visits  for Entrepreneurs \u201d (Cespedes), provides a good overview of why/h ow to  interview  prospective customers  early  in the product  development process  to  gain insights about their unmet needs. Tom Eisenmann\u2019s Product Design  resource list includes a long section on conducting such customer discovery  interviews. Steve Blank\u2019s book, Four Steps to the Epiphany , is a seminal text  on this topic; his list of startup tools (as noted above) includes links to  videos  and many  other  resources  that will help  you \u201cget  out of the building.\u201d     \u2022 Focus groups*: Appendix A in the FIELD course note \u201c Customer Discovery  & Validation for Entrepreneurs\u201d (Cespedes, Eisenmann, Blank) offers  some  pointers on how/when/why to conduct focus groups, and you\u2019ll find more guidance online if you Google the term \u201cfocus group.\u201d The superb book  Observing the User Experience (Goodman, et al.) also devotes a chapter to  focus groups. You can learn a lot from a well -run focus group, especially  regarding  products  with  emotional,  status, or lifestyle  associations.\n\nSource: \"LTV Admin Info.docx - 2/3\"\ndiscussion?  What was the key insight you gained from one of your classmates in today\u2019s class and what follow-up question(s) would you ask them? LTV Writing Assignment #1 (Due September 27)  In a few of our cases -- particularly C16 Bio, BabbaCo, and now AllSpice -- we have seen founders feel pressure to adjust their plans based on investor feedback as to what is a more financeable path. What is your reaction to these pressures from a founder's point of view -- helpful accountability and market context, needless distraction, or something else entirely? (100-200 words)\u00a0 LTV Writing Assignment #2 (Due October 19)  Answer either one of the following (200-300 words). Be sure to apply or relate your answer to course concepts such as founder-market fit (or not), startup experiments, business model quality, and/or ethical actions: Which LTV founder has most impressed you so far and why? OR Which startup\u2019s business model has most impressed you so far and why?\u00a0 LTV Writing Assignment #3 (Due November 15) Respond to one of the three prompts (100-200 words): Given what you have learned in LTV about both hiring practices and biases in the startup ecosystem, what will you personally do to impact diversity and biases when you become a founder/joiner/VC?

In FIELD3 and PM101, we\u2019ve seen students  create poorly designed surveys with confusing and/or leading questions.   Students also often choose convenience samples \u2014 e.g., of classmates/friends who aren\u2019t in their target customer group \u2014 that yield biased results. Don\u2019t  make these mistakes!     \u2022 Analysis of rivals\u2019 features*: The book Observing the User Experience  includes a chapter on competitor research. Your task would be to  analyze  the feature sets for rivals to a startup, and make recommendations on  whether the startup should change or adapt its product in response to  findings.     \u2022 Usability test*: To run a usability test, all you need is an app/website, a  target task to complete, and a test subject or two. Tom Eisenmann\u2019s Product  Design resource list includes a section on usability testing; the books  Observing the User Experience and UX for Lean Startups discuss usability  testing at length; and we particularly recommend Steve Krug's book Rocket  Surgery Made Easy , which is a short, practical, and funny guide to the basics  of usability research. You could recruit fellow HBS\u2019ers if they are  representative of target users \u2014 for example, you mi ght ask RC students to  try completing some tasks on Canvas.

You should only  attempt to develop personas after you have a deep understanding of  prospective customers and their needs. Your project output should include  not only the personas themselves, but also discussions of their implications  for product development and/or marketing  efforts.     \u2022 User stories**: User stories are the basic building blocks of agile software  development.  If you have  a concept  for a website or an application that has  advanced to the wireframing stage, your course project could focus on generating user stories. Mike Cohn\u2019s book User Stories Applied  offers good  guidance on the why/how of developing user stories. To close the  learning  loop on a project that has user stories as its output, you should show yo ur  stories  to a programmer and get feedback  on whether  they  would  be useful  as guides for her/his  work.     \u2022 Feature  prioritization  criteria:  Every product  team  wrestles  with  creating  a  process to prioritize engineering work.

Tom Eisenmann\u2019s Product Design  resource list includes a long section on conducting such customer discovery  interviews. Steve Blank\u2019s book, Four Steps to the Epiphany , is a seminal text  on this topic; his list of startup tools (as noted above) includes links to  videos  and many  other  resources  that will help  you \u201cget  out of the building.\u201d     \u2022 Focus groups*: Appendix A in the FIELD course note \u201c Customer Discovery  & Validation for Entrepreneurs\u201d (Cespedes, Eisenmann, Blank) offers  some  pointers on how/when/why to conduct focus groups, and you\u2019ll find more guidance online if you Google the term \u201cfocus group.\u201d The superb book  Observing the User Experience (Goodman, et al.) also devotes a chapter to  focus groups.

What was the key insight you gained from one of your classmates in today\u2019s class and what follow-up question(s) would you ask them? LTV Writing Assignment #1 (Due September 27)  In a few of our cases -- particularly C16 Bio, BabbaCo, and now AllSpice -- we have seen founders feel pressure to adjust their plans based on investor feedback as to what is a more financeable path. What is your reaction to these pressures from a founder's point of view -- helpful accountability and market context, needless distraction, or something else entirely?

In FIELD3 and PM101, we\u2019ve seen students  create poorly designed surveys with confusing and/or leading questions.   Students also often choose convenience samples \u2014 e.g., of classmates/friends who aren\u2019t in their target customer group \u2014 that yield biased results. Don\u2019t  make these mistakes!     \u2022 Analysis of rivals\u2019 features*: The book Observing the User Experience  includes a chapter on competitor research. Your task would be to  analyze  the feature sets for rivals to a startup, and make recommendations on  whether the startup should change or adapt its product in response to  findings.     \u2022 Usability test*: To run a usability test, all you need is an app/website, a  target task to complete, and a test subject or two. Tom Eisenmann\u2019s Product  Design resource list includes a section on usability testing; the books  Observing the User Experience and UX for Lean Startups discuss usability  testing at length; and we particularly recommend Steve Krug's book Rocket  Surgery Made Easy , which is a short, practical, and funny guide to the basics  of usability research.

[00:04:31.34] PARIS WALLACE: Ovia Health is the leading digital health platform for women and families. We've helped millions of people start their families across fertility, pregnancy, postpartum, and parenting. You can go on the App Store, You candownload one of our apps. People share their most important health and life information, and then we give them real time feedback about what's going on, things like, I have a numb hand.

If this symptom continues for the next week, that's something you should talk to your doctor about. [00:00:28.53] PARIS WALLACE: Ovia health was my second women's health startup. My first was a company called GoodStart Genetics that I started my last year at Harvard Business School. I spent four years there, raised about $100 million in venture capital, and decided that I really wanted to get into the tech space.

First and foremost, it was around the pricing. We thought it would erode pricing and significantly limit the total addressable market. Having 50% of the market with the price that we'd have to give that channel partner wasn't attractive and would hinder our ability to raise money. [00:34:39.77] And then secondly, I think, from a mission alignment standpoint, that channel partner wanted to stop doing some of the things we were doing for users that were really valuable, and that was something that we were never going to do. So we raised a Series A to build out a direct sales force. And they went out and sold directly through some other channel partners as well as through their own contacts as we built the business out.

We thought, one, it would seriously erode our pricing and the size of the market. Secondly, again, we were at odds with them over some of the things that we thought were the right thing to do with customers-- excuse me, with users. See, I even made that mistake there because it's so hard to differentiate them. Let me start over. [00:34:18.38] PARIS WALLACE: Ultimately we decided not to work with that consumer company. First and foremost, it was around the pricing. We thought it would erode pricing and significantly limit the total addressable market. Having 50% of the market with the price that we'd have to give that channel partner wasn't attractive and would hinder our ability to raise money. [00:34:39.77] And then secondly, I think, from a mission alignment standpoint, that channel partner wanted to stop doing some of the things we were doing for users that were really valuable, and that was something that we were never going to do. So we raised a Series A to build out a direct sales force. And they went out and sold directly through some other channel partners as well as through their own contacts as we built the business out.

On one hand, neither Behrens Wu nor Kreuz has formal training in software development, which could be seen as a disadvantage given that Shippo's product and customer base are technical in nature. They have struggled to create efficient software development processes and lack general business experience. Behrens Wu's internship experience in customer acquisition may have prepared her for a business-to-consumer (B2C) environment, but not necessarily for a B2B firm that sells to developers. On the other hand, Behrens Wu has demonstrated a commitment to enterprise users and gained a deep appreciation for the power of API technology while building her e-commerce business, Popout, Inc. She also has an authentic interest in the shipping industry due to her international background. The founding team has displayed persistence, grit, and savvy to seek and act on the advice of technology insiders.

In terms of product strategy, Shippo should amplify the value proposition of the API so that they are competing in areas beyond price, for example, by adding additional services like package tracking or insurance.  To spearhead this transformation to a developer-oriented strategy, Shippo might consider hiring an experienced computer scientist for an executive role such as chief of API or even chief technology officer. In that scenario, Kreuz might move into another role such as chief of product.  Wrap Up The instructor may want to wrap up the case discussion with the following closing insights: Founder-market fit can be subtle. While Behrens Wu may have lacked provable technical skills, she had the grit, courage, strategic skills, charisma, and persistence that start-up founders need to be successful in a highly competitive funding environment. Some call this the X factor; others refer to \u201cforce of nature\u201d entrepreneurs. Whatever you call it, great founders don\u2019t just have relevant experience and history but can also simply have huge amounts of hustle and other skills to achieve founder-market fit. Rapid customer growth can appear to indicate product-market fit, but may actually represent a false positive. In the case of Shippo, the team offered a strong value proposition and had a good delivery platform (channel), but as churn data shows, the initial product\n\nSource: \"Shippo Teaching Plan.docx - 5/24\"\nBehrens Wu has an authentic interest in and stake in the shipping industry because it allows people who live in different places to access the same products (case p. 4). \u201cX Factor.\u201d If they do not have founder-market fit on paper, Shippo\u2019s leaders have something special, often referred to as an \u201cX factor\u201d by investors. The founding team has displayed persistence, grit, and savvy to seek and act on the advice of technology insiders. The team at Plug and Play recognized these qualities when they saw an \u201cenprepreneurial sparkle\u201d in the founders\u2019 eyes (case p. 7). When she had no contacts in the technology start-up world, Behrens Wu networked her way from Germany to an internship in San Francisco (case p. 3). By building Shippo\u2019s two software products, Kreuz has demonstrated that he can learn the requisite skills to be a developer (case p. 4). While Y Combinator is a powerful voice with a strong track record in Silicon Valley, not all VCs are as biased toward technical founders. In addition, Shippo has some business experience: Kreuz has an MBA and Behrens Wu studied in a graduate business program (case pp. 3-4).

No. Shippo lacks founder-market fit because neither Behrens Wu nor Kreuz has formal training in software development. They have already struggled to create efficient software development processes, as exemplified by Figure 2 (case p. 7). They also lack general business experience. Behrens Wu\u2019s internship experience in customer acquisition perhaps prepared her modestly for a business-to-consumer (B2C) environment, not a B2B firm that sells to developers.  The founders\u2019 brief experience as an e-commerce retailer (and Shopify client) makes them sympathetic to the needs of small business owners but does not prepare them to recruit developers. This non-technical team will struggle to attract developers through inbound marketing. The team\u2019s Y Combinator rejection suggests that technology investors are often biased towards entrepreneurs who have a technical background themselves, particularly when the product and customer are technical in nature, as is the case with Shippo.  Yes. Behrens Wu has demonstrated a commitment to enterprise users. She gained a deep appreciation for the power of API technology, specifically payment API Stripe, while building her e-commerce business Popout, Inc. (case p. 4). As someone who has lived in many countries, Behrens Wu has an authentic interest in and stake in the shipping industry because it allows people who live in different places to access the same products (case p. 4). \u201cX Factor.\u201d If they do\n\nSource: \"Shippo Teaching Plan.docx - 21/24\"\nan MVP to test and establish product-market fit, entrepreneurs postpone the costs and time associated with fixing the product\u2019s bugs. This technical debt must be repaid in the future to align the product\u2019s quality with customer expectations.  Finally, the instructor may want to conclude the class with a quick update on Shippo\u2019s developments since November 2014. Following the $2 million seed round, Shippo went on to raise $7 million in series A round led by Union Square Ventures (USV). Following the round, USV\u2019s Albert Wenger joined the Shippo board of directors. By September 2016, 10,000 companies together shipped millions of packages using Shippo\u2019s software each month. In addition, Shippo hired engineer Sin-Mei Tsai to serve as vice president of engineering and e-commerce marketer Mikhail Ledvich as head of marketing. In September 2016, Shippo had 28 employees, and offered both a dashboard app and an API, but had decided to focus more tightly on the API strategy as its main growth engine. In a 2016 blogpost, Behrens Wu reflected on the future of her company: \u201cRaising this round is really about growing the company. We will be using the money to hire the right team of people with the skills and experience to move us through a period of rapid growth and scaling.\u201d  Board Plan and Exhibits Board 1 Board 2 Board 2 (continued) App Customer    App Customer                    API Customer    API Customer 40              labels per month                1,300           labels per\n\nSource: \"Shippo Teaching Plan.docx - 10/24\"\nShopify. If a student volunteers to share his or her experiences, ask the student to describe order fulfillment at that company, including which shipping providers were used and why. If the student used the Shopify platform after September 2015, they may have opted to use Shopify\u2019s internal shipping functionality to fulfill orders instead of an app like Shippo.  Invite students with programming experience to discuss the implications of the API-focused strategy and the architecture Shippo has chosen (case Figure 2). By not initially designing the dashboard on top of their own API, Shippo has some built-in limitations. Behrens Wu explains on page 7: \u201cWhen we added a new API functionality, we had to add a user interface element to the app to allow the user to interact with it.\u201d Use the figure, the quote and the experience of a few students who have been software developers to explain the difficulties in scaling the API and the app in parallel and the importance of focusing on one or the other\u2014along with the potential for a re-architecture in the future to pay down the technical debt from the initial MVP. Note that this discussion will lay some important groundwork for the \u201cWhat Next?\u201d pasture. Product Metrics Now that students have described the basic business model and concept, ask them to analyze Shippo\u2019s customer traction so far (refer students to case Exhibit 7).

Shippo had seven  employees : the two founders ; two employees  handling marketing, customer service, and business development ; and three software engineers .

Shippo was developing two very different customer personas , and the team worried they did not  have the resources to cater to both.  The smal l businesses had been the backbone of Shippo\u2019s growth.

In September 2016, Shippo had 28 employees, and offered both a dashboard app and an API, but had decided to focus more tightly on the API strategy as its main growth engine. In a 2016 blogpost, Behrens Wu reflected on the future of her company: \u201cRaising this round is really about growing the company.

If a student volunteers to share his or her experiences, ask the student to describe order fulfillment at that company, including which shipping providers were used and why. If the student used the Shopify platform after September 2015, they may have opted to use Shopify\u2019s internal shipping functionality to fulfill orders instead of an app like Shippo.  Invite students with programming experience to discuss the implications of the API-focused strategy and the architecture Shippo has chosen (case Figure 2). By not initially designing the dashboard on top of their own API, Shippo has some built-in limitations. Behrens Wu explains on page 7: \u201cWhen we added a new API functionality, we had to add a user interface element to the app to allow the user to interact with it.\u201d Use the figure, the quote and the experience of a few students who have been software developers to explain the difficulties in scaling the API and the app in parallel and the importance of focusing on one or the other\u2014along with the potential for a re-architecture in the future to pay down the technical debt from the initial MVP. Note that this discussion will lay some important groundwork for the \u201cWhat Next?\u201d pasture.

Responses can be recorded on Board 1. No. Shippo lacks founder-market fit because neither Behrens Wu nor Kreuz has formal training in software development. They have already struggled to create efficient software development processes, as exemplified by Figure 2 (case p. 7). They also lack general business experience. Behrens Wu\u2019s internship experience in customer acquisition perhaps prepared her modestly for a business-to-consumer (B2C) environment, not a B2B firm that sells to developers.  The founders\u2019 brief experience as an e-commerce retailer (and Shopify client) makes them sympathetic to the needs of small business owners but does not prepare them to recruit developers. This non-technical team will struggle to attract developers through inbound marketing. The team\u2019s Y Combinator rejection suggests that technology investors are often biased towards entrepreneurs who have a technical background themselves, particularly when the product and customer are technical in nature, as is the case with Shippo.  Yes. Behrens Wu has demonstrated a commitment to enterprise users. She gained a deep appreciation for the power of API technology, specifically payment API Stripe, while building her e-commerce business Popout, Inc. (case p. 4). As someone who has lived in many countries, Behrens Wu has an authentic interest in and stake in the shipping industry because it allows people who live in different places to access the same products (case p. 4). \u201cX Factor.\u201d If they do\nSource: \"Shippo 817065-PDF-ENG.pdf - Page 18\"\n817-065 Delivering the Goods at Shippo   18 Exhibit 6Shippo Seed Round Pitch Deck , 2014     founders@goshippo.com angel.co/shippo April March$5,000$10,000$1,000,000 run ratefounders@goshippo.com angel.co/shippo 1,500,000 packages committed  2014 founders@goshippo.com angel.co/shippo integration into Magento\nSource: \"Shippo 817065-PDF-ENG.pdf - Page 12\"\n817-065 Delivering the Goods at Shippo   12 busin ess, just like Expedia or Kayak,\u201d said cofounder Jeremy Bodenhamer  in 2013.63 \u201cSo just like when  you need a plane ticket, you don\u2019t go to American Airlines, you go to Expedia.com, when you want to  ship something you won\u2019t go to FedEx.com, you\u2019ll go to ShipHawk.\u201d64   Decisions   In October 2014, Shippo had 1,400 app customers and 20 API customers, who printed a combined  87,000 shipping labels  that month .

    "answer": "Equity dilution over time can vary greatly depending on the number of funding rounds and the amount of capital raised in each round. However, there are some general rules of thumb. For instance, in each round of financing, it's typical to avoid selling more than 20% of your company, which means you could expect around 20% dilution per round. However, this can sometimes be pushed to 25% or even 30% in some cases. It's also important to note that the dilution is a function of the amount of capital you raise and your post-money valuation. For example, if you were to raise $5M on a $50M post-money valuation, you would be selling 10% of the company and thus diluting yourself by 10%. Over the course of a startup's life, especially if it goes through multiple rounds of financing from pre-seed through Series A, B, C, and beyond, the cumulative dilution can be significant.",

The goal is to have the value of the startup go up by enough that you own a smaller percentage of a much larger business and therefore your total personal value goes up. The simplest way to think about this is: If you own 20% of a $2 million company your stake is worth $400,000. If you raise a new round venture capital (say $2.5 million at a $7.5 million pre-money valuation, which is a $10 million post-money) you get diluted by 25% (2.5m / 10m). So you own 15% of the new company but that 15% is now worth $1.5 million or a gain of $1.1 million. But understanding how you\u2019re likely to get diluted over time is a more difficult concept.

In my experience, because founders are subject to four year vesting like everyone else, there are thoughtful conversations about founder incentives 5+ years into a startup's life. We tend to arrange for annual stock option grants for both the founders and top team members so that their \"hold\" (i.e., the value of their unvested shares) continues to be a significant incentive. We also tend to encourage founders to take money off the table. My target is usually $2-4M after tax as it's enough to pay down the mortgage/buy a nice home, have money for kids' college, and be able to focus on going long. I recently bought $4M from one of my founder/CEOs who started the company when he was in college and had zero liquidity over 8 years of company-building despite his 20% stake now being worth $100m on paper. Another rule of thumb is to sell 5-10% of their total holdings. In general, founders get well taken care of if they're performing well. If you don't want accountability from investors or a board of directors that you have to answer to, you need to make the Rich vs. King trade off (aka\u00a0The Founder's Dilemma). In tech, it's not much of a choice because you typically need to raise upfront\n\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2011/09/introducing-the-cap-table-and-hiring-the-cto/\"\nWhen you read the cap table, think of it as a series of events that add new columns to the right. Now there are two events: the initial issuance of founders common shares, and then issuing new founders common shares along with creating an options pool. In this manner, you can see both the current equity distribution of the company, as well as historically what the equity holdings looked like. If the full pool were to be given out, the dilution is fairly significant to the founders. They would own from 55% and 45% down to 36% and 29%, but until options are exercised they are not diluted. Jane and Dick contemplated a small option pool because they had read about the risk of an option pool shuffle, but ultimately decided to make it 20% based on feedback from their friend Josh, a Boston-based venture capitalist. Our (now three) co-founders begin building out their product. The co-founders have savings to live off of and cash will be conserved by not having any salaries.

When the Chief founders mapped out their two plans and the operating expenses required to achieve their two valuation inflection points, they came to the conclusion that they should raise $5 million on the low end\u2014for the more conservative plan\u2014and $20 million on the high end for the more aggressive plan. Entering in a number of assumptions regarding the company\u2019s post-money valuation allows you to draw out this dilution matrix: Post $ Valuation    Raise $5M    Raise $10M    Raise $15M    Raise $20M $40M                13%          25%           38%           50% $60M                8%           17%           25%           33% $80M                6%           13%           19%           25% $100M               5%           10%           15%           20% Most founders are dilution sensitive\u2014rightfully so! They want to own as much of their company as possible. But remember my earlier reference to Rich vs. King? To build a wildly successful startup that scales, founders need to share their equity with investors and team members. How much equity is shared is the tricky question. Because founders know that there will be multiple rounds of financing from start to finish\u2014from pre-seed through Series A, B, C, and beyond\u2014there is a typical rule of thumb that you should avoid selling more than 20% of your company in any single round of financing.

Only read this red bit if you didn\u2019t quite follow the argument above. If somebody gives you money under a convertible debt note at a $2.5m valuation and another person funds you with convertible debt at $5m valuation (high resolution financing) and your equity round finally closes at a $10 million valuation \u2026 what technically happens? The most straightforward way to do the deal and what most people do is to issue the first investor 4 times more shares than the ultimate equity investor to adjust for the 4x discount in price (ie if I give you 4x the shares it\u2019s the same as though you paid 25% of the price for the shares). The second investor gets 2x more shares (50% discount). So in the end they all end up with Series A stock priced at the exact same price (say, $1.5 per share) but investor 1 & 2 have more stock than investor 3. And if I weren\u2019t simplifying the math, I\u2019d show you that the first investors get even more shares since they have a discount to the next round. So as your initial investor at a $2.5m they now have 4x the stock and thus 4x the liquidation preferences (since each share has liquidation preferences on it).\n\nSource: \"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-much-should-you-raise-in-your-vc-round-and-what-is-a-vc-looking-at-in-your-model-3b79ff436b63\"\nEvery VC knows that the amount you raise is often a proxy for your valuation.

If you\u2019ve only ever raised $500k, have limited revenue, have 7 people at your company and aren\u2019t a serial entrepreneur it\u2019s a pretty tall order to imagine going straight to $8\u201310 million unless your data is very compelling or you\u2019ve otherwise become \u201chot.\u201d If you\u2019ve raised $3 million previously, have $250k in monthly recurring revenue and 23 staff an $8\u201310 million round might be more down the fairway.\n\nSource: \"ENTRE_M3_BV3_05_17_2023 Jeff W1 Changes.docx - 69/120\"\nquickly?

If you\u2019ve only ever raised $500k, have limited revenue, have 7 people at your company and aren\u2019t a serial entrepreneur it\u2019s a pretty tall order to imagine going straight to $8\u201310 million unless your data is very compelling or you\u2019ve otherwise become \u201chot.\u201d If you\u2019ve raised $3 million previously, have $250k in monthly recurring revenue and 23 staff an $8\u201310 million round might be more down the fairway.\n\nSource: \"https://feld.com/archives/2011/09/introducing-the-cap-table-and-hiring-the-cto/\"\nWhen you read the cap table, think of it as a series of events that add new columns to the right. Now there are two events: the initial issuance of founders common shares, and then issuing new founders common shares along with creating an options pool. In this manner, you can see both the current equity distribution of the company, as well as historically what the equity holdings looked like. If the full pool were to be given out, the dilution is fairly significant to the founders. They would own from 55% and 45% down to 36% and 29%, but until options are exercised they are not diluted. Jane and Dick contemplated a small option pool because they had read about the risk of an option pool shuffle, but ultimately decided to make it 20% based on feedback from their friend Josh, a Boston-based venture capitalist. Our (now three) co-founders begin building out their product. The co-founders have savings to live off of and cash will be conserved by not having any salaries. Next week we will fast forward to when they have a beta product and they build a model to pitch to investors.\n\nSource: \"ENTRE_M3_BV3_05_17_2023 Jeff W1 Changes.docx - 70/120\"\n$5M on a $50M post-money valuation, they are selling 10% of the company and thus diluting themselves by 10%.  When the Chief founders mapped out their two plans and the operating expenses required to achieve their two valuation inflection points, they came to the conclusion that they should raise $5 million on the low end\u2014for the more conservative plan\u2014and $20 million on the high end for the more aggressive plan. Entering in a number of assumptions regarding the company\u2019s post-money valuation allows you to draw out this dilution matrix: Post $ Valuation    Raise $5M    Raise $10M    Raise $15M    Raise $20M $40M                13%          25%           38%           50% $60M                8%           17%           25%           33% $80M                6%           13%           19%           25% $100M               5%           10%           15%           20% Most founders are dilution sensitive\u2014rightfully so! They want to own as much of their company as possible. But remember my earlier reference to Rich vs. King? To build a wildly successful startup that scales, founders need to share their equity with investors and team members. How much equity is shared is the tricky question. Because founders know that there will be multiple rounds of financing from start to finish\u2014from pre-seed through Series A, B, C, and beyond\u2014there is a typical rule of thumb that you should avoid selling more than 20% of your company in any single round of financing. That rule isn\u2019t\n\nSource: \"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/the-truth-about-convertible-debt-at-startups-and-the-hidden-terms-you-didn-t-understand-9fccf6854dee\"\n[update: Adeo thought that I hadn\u2019t quite explained easily enough why this creates a 3x liquidation preference so I agreed to expand. Only read this red bit if you didn\u2019t quite follow the argument above. If somebody gives you money under a convertible debt note at a $2.5m valuation and another person funds you with convertible debt at $5m valuation (high resolution financing) and your equity round finally closes at a $10 million valuation \u2026 what technically happens? The most straightforward way to do the deal and what most people do is to issue the first investor 4 times more shares than the ultimate equity investor to adjust for the 4x discount in price (ie if I give you 4x the shares it\u2019s the same as though you paid 25% of the price for the shares). The second investor gets 2x more shares (50% discount). So in the end they all end up with Series A stock priced at the exact same price (say, $1.5 per share) but investor 1 & 2 have more stock than investor 3. And if I weren\u2019t simplifying the math, I\u2019d show you that the first investors get even more shares since they have a discount to the next round. So as your initial investor at a $2.5m they now have 4x the stock and thus 4x the liquidation preferences (since each share has liquidation preferences on it).\n\n\nSource: \"https://bothsidesofthetable.com/understanding-how-dilution-affects-you-at-a-startup-4fb4cd29ad5c\"\n[Understanding How Dilution Affects You at a Startup]\n\n",
